3	

3	3	THE GOLDEN BIRD

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a tree

3	

3	3	which bore golden apples. These apples were always counted, and about

3	

3	3	the time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one

3	

3	3	of them was gone. The king became very angry at this, and ordered the

3	

3	3	gardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his

3	

3	3	eldest son to watch; but about twelve o’clock he fell asleep, and in

3	

3	3	the morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was

3	

3	3	ordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning

3	

3	3	another apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep watch; but

3	

3	3	the gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come

3	

3	3	to him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself

3	

3	3	under the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling

3	

3	3	noise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as

3	

3	3	it was snapping at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener’s son

3	

3	3	jumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm;

3	

3	3	only it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then flew away.

3	

3	3	The golden feather was brought to the king in the morning, and all the

3	

3	3	council was called together. Everyone agreed that it was worth more than

3	

3	3	all the wealth of the kingdom: but the king said, ‘One feather is of no

3	

3	3	use to me, I must have the whole bird.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the gardener’s eldest son set out and thought to find the golden

3	

3	3	bird very easily; and when he had gone but a little way, he came to a

3	

3	3	wood, and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting; so he took his

3	

3	3	bow and made ready to shoot at it. Then the fox said, ‘Do not shoot me,

3	

3	3	for I will give you good counsel; I know what your business is, and

3	

3	3	that you want to find the golden bird. You will reach a village in the

3	

3	3	evening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to each

3	

3	3	other, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in

3	

3	3	there, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you

3	

3	3	to be very poor and mean.’ But the son thought to himself, ‘What can

3	

3	3	such a beast as this know about the matter?’ So he shot his arrow at

3	

3	3	the fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail above its back and

3	

3	3	ran into the wood. Then he went his way, and in the evening came to

3	

3	3	the village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people

3	

3	3	singing, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked very dirty,

3	

3	3	and poor. ‘I should be very silly,’ said he, ‘if I went to that shabby

3	

3	3	house, and left this charming place’; so he went into the smart house,

3	

3	3	and ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the bird, and his country too.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Time passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no tidings

3	

3	3	were heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing happened

3	

3	3	to him. He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but when he came

3	

3	3	to the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the window where

3	

3	3	the merrymaking was, and called to him to come in; and he could not

3	

3	3	withstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden bird and

3	

3	3	his country in the same manner.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Time passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set out into

3	

3	3	the wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not

3	

3	3	listen to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and

3	

3	3	was afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent his

3	

3	3	coming back. However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he would

3	

3	3	not rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox, and heard

3	

3	3	the same good counsel. But he was thankful to the fox, and did not

3	

3	3	attempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said, ‘Sit upon my

3	

3	3	tail, and you will travel faster.’ So he sat down, and the fox began to

3	

3	3	run, and away they went over stock and stone so quick that their hair

3	

3	3	whistled in the wind.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When they came to the village, the son followed the fox’s counsel, and

3	

3	3	without looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all

3	

3	3	night at his ease. In the morning came the fox again and met him as he

3	

3	3	was beginning his journey, and said, ‘Go straight forward, till you come

3	

3	3	to a castle, before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep and

3	

3	3	snoring: take no notice of them, but go into the castle and pass on and

3	

3	3	on till you come to a room, where the golden bird sits in a wooden cage;

3	

3	3	close by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but do not try to take the

3	

3	3	bird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one, otherwise

3	

3	3	you will repent it.’ Then the fox stretched out his tail again, and the

3	

3	3	young man sat himself down, and away they went over stock and stone till

3	

3	3	their hair whistled in the wind.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Before the castle gate all was as the fox had said: so the son went in

3	

3	3	and found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage, and

3	

3	3	below stood the golden cage, and the three golden apples that had been

3	

3	3	lost were lying close by it. Then thought he to himself, ‘It will be a

3	

3	3	very droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cage’; so

3	

3	3	he opened the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden cage.

3	

3	3	But the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke, and

3	

3	3	they took him prisoner and carried him before the king. The next morning

3	

3	3	the court sat to judge him; and when all was heard, it sentenced him to

3	

3	3	die, unless he should bring the king the golden horse which could run as

3	

3	3	swiftly as the wind; and if he did this, he was to have the golden bird

3	

3	3	given him for his own.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	So he set out once more on his journey, sighing, and in great despair,

3	

3	3	when on a sudden his friend the fox met him, and said, ‘You see now

3	

3	3	what has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel. I will

3	

3	3	still, however, tell you how to find the golden horse, if you will do as

3	

3	3	I bid you. You must go straight on till you come to the castle where the

3	

3	3	horse stands in his stall: by his side will lie the groom fast asleep

3	

3	3	and snoring: take away the horse quietly, but be sure to put the old

3	

3	3	leathern saddle upon him, and not the golden one that is close by it.’

3	

3	3	Then the son sat down on the fox’s tail, and away they went over stock

3	

3	3	and stone till their hair whistled in the wind.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	All went right, and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the golden

3	

3	3	saddle. But when the son looked at the horse, he thought it a great pity

3	

3	3	to put the leathern saddle upon it. ‘I will give him the good one,’

3	

3	3	said he; ‘I am sure he deserves it.’ As he took up the golden saddle the

3	

3	3	groom awoke and cried out so loud, that all the guards ran in and took

3	

3	3	him prisoner, and in the morning he was again brought before the court

3	

3	3	to be judged, and was sentenced to die. But it was agreed, that, if he

3	

3	3	could bring thither the beautiful princess, he should live, and have the

3	

3	3	bird and the horse given him for his own.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then he went his way very sorrowful; but the old fox came and said, ‘Why

3	

3	3	did not you listen to me? If you had, you would have carried away

3	

3	3	both the bird and the horse; yet will I once more give you counsel. Go

3	

3	3	straight on, and in the evening you will arrive at a castle. At twelve

3	

3	3	o’clock at night the princess goes to the bathing-house: go up to her

3	

3	3	and give her a kiss, and she will let you lead her away; but take care

3	

3	3	you do not suffer her to go and take leave of her father and mother.’

3	

3	3	Then the fox stretched out his tail, and so away they went over stock

3	

3	3	and stone till their hair whistled again.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	As they came to the castle, all was as the fox had said, and at twelve

3	

3	3	o’clock the young man met the princess going to the bath and gave her the

3	

3	3	kiss, and she agreed to run away with him, but begged with many tears

3	

3	3	that he would let her take leave of her father. At first he refused,

3	

3	3	but she wept still more and more, and fell at his feet, till at last

3	

3	3	he consented; but the moment she came to her father’s house the guards

3	

3	3	awoke and he was taken prisoner again.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then he was brought before the king, and the king said, ‘You shall never

3	

3	3	have my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill that stops

3	

3	3	the view from my window.’ Now this hill was so big that the whole world

3	

3	3	could not take it away: and when he had worked for seven days, and had

3	

3	3	done very little, the fox came and said. ‘Lie down and go to sleep; I

3	

3	3	will work for you.’ And in the morning he awoke and the hill was gone;

3	

3	3	so he went merrily to the king, and told him that now that it was

3	

3	3	removed he must give him the princess.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the king was obliged to keep his word, and away went the young man

3	

3	3	and the princess; and the fox came and said to him, ‘We will have all

3	

3	3	three, the princess, the horse, and the bird.’ ‘Ah!’ said the young man,

3	

3	3	‘that would be a great thing, but how can you contrive it?’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘If you will only listen,’ said the fox, ‘it can be done. When you come

3	

3	3	to the king, and he asks for the beautiful princess, you must say, “Here

3	

3	3	she is!” Then he will be very joyful; and you will mount the golden

3	

3	3	horse that they are to give you, and put out your hand to take leave of

3	

3	3	them; but shake hands with the princess last. Then lift her quickly on

3	

3	3	to the horse behind you; clap your spurs to his side, and gallop away as

3	

3	3	fast as you can.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	All went right: then the fox said, ‘When you come to the castle where

3	

3	3	the bird is, I will stay with the princess at the door, and you will

3	

3	3	ride in and speak to the king; and when he sees that it is the right

3	

3	3	horse, he will bring out the bird; but you must sit still, and say that

3	

3	3	you want to look at it, to see whether it is the true golden bird; and

3	

3	3	when you get it into your hand, ride away.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	This, too, happened as the fox said; they carried off the bird, the

3	

3	3	princess mounted again, and they rode on to a great wood. Then the fox

3	

3	3	came, and said, ‘Pray kill me, and cut off my head and my feet.’ But the

3	

3	3	young man refused to do it: so the fox said, ‘I will at any rate give

3	

3	3	you good counsel: beware of two things; ransom no one from the gallows,

3	

3	3	and sit down by the side of no river.’ Then away he went. ‘Well,’

3	

3	3	thought the young man, ‘it is no hard matter to keep that advice.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	He rode on with the princess, till at last he came to the village where

3	

3	3	he had left his two brothers. And there he heard a great noise and

3	

3	3	uproar; and when he asked what was the matter, the people said, ‘Two men

3	

3	3	are going to be hanged.’ As he came nearer, he saw that the two men were

3	

3	3	his brothers, who had turned robbers; so he said, ‘Cannot they in any

3	

3	3	way be saved?’ But the people said ‘No,’ unless he would bestow all his

3	

3	3	money upon the rascals and buy their liberty. Then he did not stay to

3	

3	3	think about the matter, but paid what was asked, and his brothers were

3	

3	3	given up, and went on with him towards their home.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And as they came to the wood where the fox first met them, it was so

3	

3	3	cool and pleasant that the two brothers said, ‘Let us sit down by the

3	

3	3	side of the river, and rest a while, to eat and drink.’ So he said,

3	

3	3	‘Yes,’ and forgot the fox’s counsel, and sat down on the side of the

3	

3	3	river; and while he suspected nothing, they came behind, and threw him

3	

3	3	down the bank, and took the princess, the horse, and the bird, and went

3	

3	3	home to the king their master, and said. ‘All this have we won by our

3	

3	3	labour.’ Then there was great rejoicing made; but the horse would not

3	

3	3	eat, the bird would not sing, and the princess wept.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The youngest son fell to the bottom of the river’s bed: luckily it was

3	

3	3	nearly dry, but his bones were almost broken, and the bank was so steep

3	

3	3	that he could find no way to get out. Then the old fox came once more,

3	

3	3	and scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise no evil would

3	

3	3	have befallen him: ‘Yet,’ said he, ‘I cannot leave you here, so lay hold

3	

3	3	of my tail and hold fast.’ Then he pulled him out of the river, and said

3	

3	3	to him, as he got upon the bank, ‘Your brothers have set watch to kill

3	

3	3	you, if they find you in the kingdom.’ So he dressed himself as a poor

3	

3	3	man, and came secretly to the king’s court, and was scarcely within the

3	

3	3	doors when the horse began to eat, and the bird to sing, and the princess

3	

3	3	left off weeping. Then he went to the king, and told him all his

3	

3	3	brothers’ roguery; and they were seized and punished, and he had the

3	

3	3	princess given to him again; and after the king’s death he was heir to

3	

3	3	his kingdom.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	A long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the old fox

3	

3	3	met him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him, and cut

3	

3	3	off his head and feet. And at last he did so, and in a moment the

3	

3	3	fox was changed into a man, and turned out to be the brother of the

3	

3	3	princess, who had been lost a great many many years.

3	

3	3	right--all that falls to them is so much gain--all their geese are

3	

3	3	swans--all their cards are trumps--toss them which way you will, they

3	

3	3	will always, like poor puss, alight upon their legs, and only move on so

3	

3	3	much the faster. The world may very likely not always think of them as

3	

3	3	they think of themselves, but what care they for the world? what can it

3	

3	3	know about the matter?

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	One of these lucky beings was neighbour Hans. Seven long years he had

3	

3	3	worked hard for his master. At last he said, ‘Master, my time is up; I

3	

3	3	must go home and see my poor mother once more: so pray pay me my wages

3	

3	3	and let me go.’ And the master said, ‘You have been a faithful and good

3	

3	3	servant, Hans, so your pay shall be handsome.’ Then he gave him a lump

3	

3	3	of silver as big as his head.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Hans took out his pocket-handkerchief, put the piece of silver into it,

3	

3	3	threw it over his shoulder, and jogged off on his road homewards. As he

3	

3	3	went lazily on, dragging one foot after another, a man came in sight,

3	

3	3	trotting gaily along on a capital horse. ‘Ah!’ said Hans aloud, ‘what a

3	

3	3	fine thing it is to ride on horseback! There he sits as easy and happy

3	

3	3	as if he was at home, in the chair by his fireside; he trips against no

3	

3	3	stones, saves shoe-leather, and gets on he hardly knows how.’ Hans did

3	

3	3	not speak so softly but the horseman heard it all, and said, ‘Well,

3	

3	3	friend, why do you go on foot then?’ ‘Ah!’ said he, ‘I have this load to

3	

3	3	carry: to be sure it is silver, but it is so heavy that I can’t hold up

3	

3	3	my head, and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly.’ ‘What do you say

3	

3	3	of making an exchange?’ said the horseman. ‘I will give you my horse,

3	

3	3	and you shall give me the silver; which will save you a great deal of

3	

3	3	trouble in carrying such a heavy load about with you.’ ‘With all my

3	

3	3	heart,’ said Hans: ‘but as you are so kind to me, I must tell you one

3	

3	3	thing--you will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you.’

3	

3	3	However, the horseman got off, took the silver, helped Hans up, gave him

3	

3	3	the bridle into one hand and the whip into the other, and said, ‘When

3	

3	3	you want to go very fast, smack your lips loudly together, and cry

3	

3	3	“Jip!”’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Hans was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up, squared his

3	

3	3	elbows, turned out his toes, cracked his whip, and rode merrily off, one

3	

3	3	minute whistling a merry tune, and another singing,

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘No care and no sorrow,

3	

3	3	  A fig for the morrow!

3	

3	3	  We’ll laugh and be merry,

3	

3	3	  Sing neigh down derry!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	After a time he thought he should like to go a little faster, so he

3	

3	3	smacked his lips and cried ‘Jip!’ Away went the horse full gallop; and

3	

3	3	before Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his

3	

3	3	back by the road-side. His horse would have ran off, if a shepherd who

3	

3	3	was coming by, driving a cow, had not stopped it. Hans soon came to

3	

3	3	himself, and got upon his legs again, sadly vexed, and said to the

3	

3	3	shepherd, ‘This riding is no joke, when a man has the luck to get upon

3	

3	3	a beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would break

3	

3	3	his neck. However, I’m off now once for all: I like your cow now a great

3	

3	3	deal better than this smart beast that played me this trick, and has

3	

3	3	spoiled my best coat, you see, in this puddle; which, by the by, smells

3	

3	3	not very like a nosegay. One can walk along at one’s leisure behind that

3	

3	3	cow--keep good company, and have milk, butter, and cheese, every day,

3	

3	3	into the bargain. What would I give to have such a prize!’ ‘Well,’ said

3	

3	3	the shepherd, ‘if you are so fond of her, I will change my cow for your

3	

3	3	horse; I like to do good to my neighbours, even though I lose by it

3	

3	3	myself.’ ‘Done!’ said Hans, merrily. ‘What a noble heart that good man

3	

3	3	has!’ thought he. Then the shepherd jumped upon the horse, wished Hans

3	

3	3	and the cow good morning, and away he rode.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Hans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and

3	

3	3	then drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky

3	

3	3	one. ‘If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly shall always be

3	

3	3	able to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese with

3	

3	3	it; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what

3	

3	3	can I wish for more?’ When he came to an inn, he halted, ate up all his

3	

3	3	bread, and gave away his last penny for a glass of beer. When he had

3	

3	3	rested himself he set off again, driving his cow towards his mother’s

3	

3	3	village. But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on, till at

3	

3	3	last, as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than

3	

3	3	an hour to cross, he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue

3	

3	3	clave to the roof of his mouth. ‘I can find a cure for this,’ thought

3	

3	3	he; ‘now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst’: so he tied her to the

3	

3	3	stump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop

3	

3	3	was to be had. Who would have thought that this cow, which was to bring

3	

3	3	him milk and butter and cheese, was all that time utterly dry? Hans had

3	

3	3	not thought of looking to that.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	While he was trying his luck in milking, and managing the matter very

3	

3	3	clumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at

3	

3	3	last gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he

3	

3	3	lay a long while senseless. Luckily a butcher soon came by, driving a

3	

3	3	pig in a wheelbarrow. ‘What is the matter with you, my man?’ said the

3	

3	3	butcher, as he helped him up. Hans told him what had happened, how he

3	

3	3	was dry, and wanted to milk his cow, but found the cow was dry too. Then

3	

3	3	the butcher gave him a flask of ale, saying, ‘There, drink and refresh

3	

3	3	yourself; your cow will give you no milk: don’t you see she is an old

3	

3	3	beast, good for nothing but the slaughter-house?’ ‘Alas, alas!’ said

3	

3	3	Hans, ‘who would have thought it? What a shame to take my horse, and

3	

3	3	give me only a dry cow! If I kill her, what will she be good for? I hate

3	

3	3	cow-beef; it is not tender enough for me. If it were a pig now--like

3	

3	3	that fat gentleman you are driving along at his ease--one could do

3	

3	3	something with it; it would at any rate make sausages.’ ‘Well,’ said

3	

3	3	the butcher, ‘I don’t like to say no, when one is asked to do a kind,

3	

3	3	neighbourly thing. To please you I will change, and give you my fine fat

3	

3	3	pig for the cow.’ ‘Heaven reward you for your kindness and self-denial!’

3	

3	3	said Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the

3	

3	3	wheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to

3	

3	3	its leg.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	So on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met

3	

3	3	with some misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all.

3	

3	3	How could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as he had at

3	

3	3	last got?

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The next man he met was a countryman carrying a fine white goose. The

3	

3	3	countryman stopped to ask what was o’clock; this led to further chat;

3	

3	3	and Hans told him all his luck, how he had so many good bargains, and

3	

3	3	how all the world went gay and smiling with him. The countryman then

3	

3	3	began to tell his tale, and said he was going to take the goose to a

3	

3	3	christening. ‘Feel,’ said he, ‘how heavy it is, and yet it is only eight

3	

3	3	weeks old. Whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon it,

3	

3	3	it has lived so well!’ ‘You’re right,’ said Hans, as he weighed it in

3	

3	3	his hand; ‘but if you talk of fat, my pig is no trifle.’ Meantime the

3	

3	3	countryman began to look grave, and shook his head. ‘Hark ye!’ said he,

3	

3	3	‘my worthy friend, you seem a good sort of fellow, so I can’t help doing

3	

3	3	you a kind turn. Your pig may get you into a scrape. In the village I

3	

3	3	just came from, the squire has had a pig stolen out of his sty. I was

3	

3	3	dreadfully afraid when I saw you that you had got the squire’s pig. If

3	

3	3	you have, and they catch you, it will be a bad job for you. The least

3	

3	3	they will do will be to throw you into the horse-pond. Can you swim?’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Poor Hans was sadly frightened. ‘Good man,’ cried he, ‘pray get me out

3	

3	3	of this scrape. I know nothing of where the pig was either bred or born;

3	

3	3	but he may have been the squire’s for aught I can tell: you know this

3	

3	3	country better than I do, take my pig and give me the goose.’ ‘I ought

3	

3	3	to have something into the bargain,’ said the countryman; ‘give a fat

3	

3	3	goose for a pig, indeed! ‘Tis not everyone would do so much for you as

3	

3	3	that. However, I will not be hard upon you, as you are in trouble.’ Then

3	

3	3	he took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path;

3	

3	3	while Hans went on the way homewards free from care. ‘After all,’

3	

3	3	thought he, ‘that chap is pretty well taken in. I don’t care whose pig

3	

3	3	it is, but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me. I

3	

3	3	have much the best of the bargain. First there will be a capital roast;

3	

3	3	then the fat will find me in goose-grease for six months; and then there

3	

3	3	are all the beautiful white feathers. I will put them into my pillow,

3	

3	3	and then I am sure I shall sleep soundly without rocking. How happy my

3	

3	3	mother will be! Talk of a pig, indeed! Give me a fine fat goose.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	As he came to the next village, he saw a scissor-grinder with his wheel,

3	

3	3	working and singing,

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘O’er hill and o’er dale

3	

3	3	  So happy I roam,

3	

3	3	  Work light and live well,

3	

3	3	  All the world is my home;

3	

3	3	  Then who so blythe, so merry as I?’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Hans stood looking on for a while, and at last said, ‘You must be well

3	

3	3	off, master grinder! you seem so happy at your work.’ ‘Yes,’ said the

3	

3	3	other, ‘mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts his hand

3	

3	3	into his pocket without finding money in it--but where did you get that

3	

3	3	beautiful goose?’ ‘I did not buy it, I gave a pig for it.’ ‘And where

3	

3	3	did you get the pig?’ ‘I gave a cow for it.’ ‘And the cow?’ ‘I gave a

3	

3	3	horse for it.’ ‘And the horse?’ ‘I gave a lump of silver as big as my

3	

3	3	head for it.’ ‘And the silver?’ ‘Oh! I worked hard for that seven long

3	

3	3	years.’ ‘You have thriven well in the world hitherto,’ said the grinder,

3	

3	3	‘now if you could find money in your pocket whenever you put your hand

3	

3	3	in it, your fortune would be made.’ ‘Very true: but how is that to be

3	

3	3	managed?’ ‘How? Why, you must turn grinder like myself,’ said the other;

3	

3	3	‘you only want a grindstone; the rest will come of itself. Here is one

3	

3	3	that is but little the worse for wear: I would not ask more than the

3	

3	3	value of your goose for it--will you buy?’ ‘How can you ask?’ said

3	

3	3	Hans; ‘I should be the happiest man in the world, if I could have money

3	

3	3	whenever I put my hand in my pocket: what could I want more? there’s

3	

3	3	the goose.’ ‘Now,’ said the grinder, as he gave him a common rough stone

3	

3	3	that lay by his side, ‘this is a most capital stone; do but work it well

3	

3	3	enough, and you can make an old nail cut with it.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Hans took the stone, and went his way with a light heart: his eyes

3	

3	3	sparkled for joy, and he said to himself, ‘Surely I must have been born

3	

3	3	in a lucky hour; everything I could want or wish for comes of itself.

3	

3	3	People are so kind; they seem really to think I do them a favour in

3	

3	3	letting them make me rich, and giving me good bargains.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Meantime he began to be tired, and hungry too, for he had given away his

3	

3	3	last penny in his joy at getting the cow.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	At last he could go no farther, for the stone tired him sadly: and he

3	

3	3	dragged himself to the side of a river, that he might take a drink of

3	

3	3	water, and rest a while. So he laid the stone carefully by his side on

3	

3	3	the bank: but, as he stooped down to drink, he forgot it, pushed it a

3	

3	3	little, and down it rolled, plump into the stream.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	For a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water; then sprang

3	

3	3	up and danced for joy, and again fell upon his knees and thanked Heaven,

3	

3	3	with tears in his eyes, for its kindness in taking away his only plague,

3	

3	3	the ugly heavy stone.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘How happy am I!’ cried he; ‘nobody was ever so lucky as I.’ Then up he

3	

3	3	got with a light heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on till

3	

3	3	he reached his mother’s house, and told her how very easy the road to

3	

3	3	good luck was.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	JORINDA AND JORINDEL

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy

3	

3	3	wood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy could take

3	

3	3	any shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of

3	

3	3	an owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always

3	

3	3	became an old woman again. When any young man came within a hundred

3	

3	3	paces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step

3	

3	3	till she came and set him free; which she would not do till he had given

3	

3	3	her his word never to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came

3	

3	3	within that space she was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her

3	

3	3	into a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the castle. There were

3	

3	3	seven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle, and all with

3	

3	3	beautiful birds in them.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Now there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier

3	

3	3	than all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd

3	

3	3	lad, whose name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon

3	

3	3	to be married. One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be

3	

3	3	alone; and Jorindel said, ‘We must take care that we don’t go too near

3	

3	3	to the fairy’s castle.’ It was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the

3	

3	3	setting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon

3	

3	3	the green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall

3	

3	3	birches.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and

3	

3	3	both felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be

3	

3	3	parted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way; and when

3	

3	3	they looked to see which way they should go home, they found themselves

3	

3	3	at a loss to know what path to take.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk behind

3	

3	3	the hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw through the

3	

3	3	bushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close under the old

3	

3	3	walls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled.

3	

3	3	Jorinda was just singing,

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘The ring-dove sang from the willow spray,

3	

3	3	  Well-a-day! Well-a-day!

3	

3	3	  He mourn’d for the fate of his darling mate,

3	

3	3	  Well-a-day!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	when her song stopped suddenly. Jorindel turned to see the reason, and

3	

3	3	beheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale, so that her song ended

3	

3	3	with a mournful _jug, jug_. An owl with fiery eyes flew three times

3	

3	3	round them, and three times screamed:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Tu whu! Tu whu! Tu whu!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Jorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither

3	

3	3	weep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot. And now the sun went quite down;

3	

3	3	the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the

3	

3	3	old fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and

3	

3	3	chin that almost met one another.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	She mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went away

3	

3	3	with it in her hand. Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gone--but

3	

3	3	what could he do? He could not speak, he could not move from the spot

3	

3	3	where he stood. At last the fairy came back and sang with a hoarse

3	

3	3	voice:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Till the prisoner is fast,

3	

3	3	  And her doom is cast,

3	

3	3	  There stay! Oh, stay!

3	

3	3	  When the charm is around her,

3	

3	3	  And the spell has bound her,

3	

3	3	  Hie away! away!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	On a sudden Jorindel found himself free. Then he fell on his knees

3	

3	3	before the fairy, and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda: but

3	

3	3	she laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then she

3	

3	3	went her way.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	He prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain. ‘Alas!’ he said, ‘what

3	

3	3	will become of me?’ He could not go back to his own home, so he went to

3	

3	3	a strange village, and employed himself in keeping sheep. Many a time

3	

3	3	did he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go,

3	

3	3	but all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	At last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower,

3	

3	3	and that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he

3	

3	3	plucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and

3	

3	3	that everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he

3	

3	3	found his Jorinda again.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	In the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale for

3	

3	3	this pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but

3	

3	3	on the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple

3	

3	3	flower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly

3	

3	3	pearl. Then he plucked the flower, and set out and travelled day and

3	

3	3	night, till he came again to the castle.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	He walked nearer than a hundred paces to it, and yet he did not become

3	

3	3	fixed as before, but found that he could go quite close up to the door.

3	

3	3	Jorindel was very glad indeed to see this. Then he touched the door with

3	

3	3	the flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court,

3	

3	3	and listened when he heard so many birds singing. At last he came to the

3	

3	3	chamber where the fairy sat, with the seven hundred birds singing in

3	

3	3	the seven hundred cages. When she saw Jorindel she was very angry, and

3	

3	3	screamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him, for

3	

3	3	the flower he held in his hand was his safeguard. He looked around at

3	

3	3	the birds, but alas! there were many, many nightingales, and how then

3	

3	3	should he find out which was his Jorinda? While he was thinking what to

3	

3	3	do, he saw the fairy had taken down one of the cages, and was making the

3	

3	3	best of her way off through the door. He ran or flew after her, touched

3	

3	3	the cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her

3	

3	3	arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when

3	

3	3	they walked together in the wood.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then he touched all the other birds with the flower, so that they all

3	

3	3	took their old forms again; and he took Jorinda home, where they were

3	

3	3	married, and lived happily together many years: and so did a good many

3	

3	3	other lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy’s

3	

3	3	cages by themselves, much longer than they liked.

3	

3	3	THE TRAVELLING MUSICIANS

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	An honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant to him

3	

3	3	a great many years, but was now growing old and every day more and more

3	

3	3	unfit for work. His master therefore was tired of keeping him and

3	

3	3	began to think of putting an end to him; but the ass, who saw that some

3	

3	3	mischief was in the wind, took himself slyly off, and began his journey

3	

3	3	towards the great city, ‘For there,’ thought he, ‘I may turn musician.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	After he had travelled a little way, he spied a dog lying by the

3	

3	3	roadside and panting as if he were tired. ‘What makes you pant so, my

3	

3	3	friend?’ said the ass. ‘Alas!’ said the dog, ‘my master was going to

3	

3	3	knock me on the head, because I am old and weak, and can no longer make

3	

3	3	myself useful to him in hunting; so I ran away; but what can I do to

3	

3	3	earn my livelihood?’ ‘Hark ye!’ said the ass, ‘I am going to the great

3	

3	3	city to turn musician: suppose you go with me, and try what you can

3	

3	3	do in the same way?’ The dog said he was willing, and they jogged on

3	

3	3	together.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	They had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the

3	

3	3	road and making a most rueful face. ‘Pray, my good lady,’ said the ass,

3	

3	3	‘what’s the matter with you? You look quite out of spirits!’ ‘Ah, me!’

3	

3	3	said the cat, ‘how can one be in good spirits when one’s life is in

3	

3	3	danger? Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my

3	

3	3	ease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress

3	

3	3	laid hold of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky

3	

3	3	enough to get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon.’

3	

3	3	‘Oh,’ said the ass, ‘by all means go with us to the great city; you are

3	

3	3	a good night singer, and may make your fortune as a musician.’ The cat

3	

3	3	was pleased with the thought, and joined the party.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Soon afterwards, as they were passing by a farmyard, they saw a cock

3	

3	3	perched upon a gate, and screaming out with all his might and main.

3	

3	3	‘Bravo!’ said the ass; ‘upon my word, you make a famous noise; pray what

3	

3	3	is all this about?’ ‘Why,’ said the cock, ‘I was just now saying that

3	

3	3	we should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my mistress and

3	

3	3	the cook don’t thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut off my

3	

3	3	head tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are coming

3	

3	3	on Sunday!’ ‘Heaven forbid!’ said the ass, ‘come with us Master

3	

3	3	Chanticleer; it will be better, at any rate, than staying here to have

3	

3	3	your head cut off! Besides, who knows? If we care to sing in tune, we

3	

3	3	may get up some kind of a concert; so come along with us.’ ‘With all my

3	

3	3	heart,’ said the cock: so they all four went on jollily together.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	They could not, however, reach the great city the first day; so when

3	

3	3	night came on, they went into a wood to sleep. The ass and the dog laid

3	

3	3	themselves down under a great tree, and the cat climbed up into the

3	

3	3	branches; while the cock, thinking that the higher he sat the safer he

3	

3	3	should be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and then, according to

3	

3	3	his custom, before he went to sleep, looked out on all sides of him to

3	

3	3	see that everything was well. In doing this, he saw afar off something

3	

3	3	bright and shining and calling to his companions said, ‘There must be a

3	

3	3	house no great way off, for I see a light.’ ‘If that be the case,’ said

3	

3	3	the ass, ‘we had better change our quarters, for our lodging is not the

3	

3	3	best in the world!’ ‘Besides,’ added the dog, ‘I should not be the

3	

3	3	worse for a bone or two, or a bit of meat.’ So they walked off together

3	

3	3	towards the spot where Chanticleer had seen the light, and as they drew

3	

3	3	near it became larger and brighter, till they at last came close to a

3	

3	3	house in which a gang of robbers lived.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The ass, being the tallest of the company, marched up to the window and

3	

3	3	peeped in. ‘Well, Donkey,’ said Chanticleer, ‘what do you see?’ ‘What

3	

3	3	do I see?’ replied the ass. ‘Why, I see a table spread with all kinds of

3	

3	3	good things, and robbers sitting round it making merry.’ ‘That would

3	

3	3	be a noble lodging for us,’ said the cock. ‘Yes,’ said the ass, ‘if we

3	

3	3	could only get in’; so they consulted together how they should contrive

3	

3	3	to get the robbers out; and at last they hit upon a plan. The ass placed

3	

3	3	himself upright on his hind legs, with his forefeet resting against the

3	

3	3	window; the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the dog’s

3	

3	3	shoulders, and the cock flew up and sat upon the cat’s head. When

3	

3	3	all was ready a signal was given, and they began their music. The ass

3	

3	3	brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock screamed; and then

3	

3	3	they all broke through the window at once, and came tumbling into

3	

3	3	the room, amongst the broken glass, with a most hideous clatter! The

3	

3	3	robbers, who had been not a little frightened by the opening concert,

3	

3	3	had now no doubt that some frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon them,

3	

3	3	and scampered away as fast as they could.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what

3	

3	3	the robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not expected

3	

3	3	to eat again for a month. As soon as they had satisfied themselves, they

3	

3	3	put out the lights, and each once more sought out a resting-place to

3	

3	3	his own liking. The donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in

3	

3	3	the yard, the dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door, the

3	

3	3	cat rolled herself up on the hearth before the warm ashes, and the

3	

3	3	cock perched upon a beam on the top of the house; and, as they were all

3	

3	3	rather tired with their journey, they soon fell asleep.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But about midnight, when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were

3	

3	3	out and that all seemed quiet, they began to think that they had been in

3	

3	3	too great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was bolder than

3	

3	3	the rest, went to see what was going on. Finding everything still, he

3	

3	3	marched into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a match in

3	

3	3	order to light a candle; and then, espying the glittering fiery eyes of

3	

3	3	the cat, he mistook them for live coals, and held the match to them to

3	

3	3	light it. But the cat, not understanding this joke, sprang at his face,

3	

3	3	and spat, and scratched at him. This frightened him dreadfully, and away

3	

3	3	he ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the

3	

3	3	leg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the

3	

3	3	cock, who had been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might. At

3	

3	3	this the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told

3	

3	3	the captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at

3	

3	3	him and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a

3	

3	3	knife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him

3	

3	3	in the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a

3	

3	3	club, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out,

3	

3	3	‘Throw the rascal up here!’ After this the robbers never dared to go

3	

3	3	back to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters

3	

3	3	that they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at

3	

3	3	this very day.

3	

3	3	OLD SULTAN

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	A shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old,

3	

3	3	and had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wife

3	

3	3	were standing together before the house the shepherd said, ‘I will shoot

3	

3	3	old Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.’ But his wife

3	

3	3	said, ‘Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a

3	

3	3	great many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of

3	

3	3	his days.’ ‘But what can we do with him?’ said the shepherd, ‘he has not

3	

3	3	a tooth in his head, and the thieves don’t care for him at all; to

3	

3	3	be sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood;

3	

3	3	tomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Poor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd

3	

3	3	and his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think

3	

3	3	tomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good

3	

3	3	friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows,

3	

3	3	and how his master meant to kill him in the morning. ‘Make yourself

3	

3	3	easy,’ said the wolf, ‘I will give you some good advice. Your master,

3	

3	3	you know, goes out every morning very early with his wife into the

3	

3	3	field; and they take their little child with them, and lay it down

3	

3	3	behind the hedge in the shade while they are at work. Now do you lie

3	

3	3	down close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come

3	

3	3	out of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as

3	

3	3	you can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they

3	

3	3	will think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you

3	

3	3	that they will take care of you as long as you live.’ The dog liked this

3	

3	3	plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed. The wolf ran with the

3	

3	3	child a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan

3	

3	3	soon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master

3	

3	3	and mistress. Then the shepherd patted him on the head, and said, ‘Old

3	

3	3	Sultan has saved our child from the wolf, and therefore he shall live

3	

3	3	and be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat. Wife, go home, and

3	

3	3	give him a good dinner, and let him have my old cushion to sleep on

3	

3	3	as long as he lives.’ So from this time forward Sultan had all that he

3	

3	3	could wish for.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Soon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, ‘Now, my

3	

3	3	good fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way

3	

3	3	when I want to taste one of the old shepherd’s fine fat sheep.’ ‘No,’

3	

3	3	said the Sultan; ‘I will be true to my master.’ However, the wolf

3	

3	3	thought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel. But

3	

3	3	Sultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait

3	

3	3	for him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for

3	

3	3	a good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed

3	

3	3	his locks for him finely.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan ‘an old rogue,’ and

3	

3	3	swore he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf sent the

3	

3	3	boar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter. Now

3	

3	3	Sultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd’s old

3	

3	3	three-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped

3	

3	3	along with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they

3	

3	3	espied their enemies coming, and saw the cat’s long tail standing

3	

3	3	straight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to

3	

3	3	fight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up

3	

3	3	a stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of

3	

3	3	fighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped

3	

3	3	up into a tree. Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked about and

3	

3	3	wondered that no one was there. The boar, however, had not quite hidden

3	

3	3	himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of

3	

3	3	them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a

3	

3	3	mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped

3	

3	3	up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, ‘Look up in the tree, there

3	

3	3	sits the one who is to blame.’ So they looked up, and espied the wolf

3	

3	3	sitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal,

3	

3	3	and would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of

3	

3	3	himself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	THE STRAW, THE COAL, AND THE BEAN

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish

3	

3	3	of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and

3	

3	3	that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw.

3	

3	3	When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her

3	

3	3	observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards

3	

3	3	a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw

3	

3	3	began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?’ The coal

3	

3	3	replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped

3	

3	3	by sheer force, my death would have been certain,--I should have been

3	

3	3	burnt to ashes.’ The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin,

3	

3	3	but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made

3	

3	3	into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.’ ‘And would a better

3	

3	3	fate have fallen to my lot?’ said the straw. ‘The old woman has

3	

3	3	destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at

3	

3	3	once, and took their lives. I luckily slipped through her fingers.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘But what are we to do now?’ said the coal.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘I think,’ answered the bean, ‘that as we have so fortunately escaped

3	

3	3	death, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new

3	

3	3	mischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and

3	

3	3	repair to a foreign country.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way

3	

3	3	together. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was

3	

3	3	no bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over

3	

3	3	it. The straw hit on a good idea, and said: ‘I will lay myself straight

3	

3	3	across, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.’ The straw

3	

3	3	therefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal,

3	

3	3	who was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the

3	

3	3	newly-built bridge. But when she had reached the middle, and heard the

3	

3	3	water rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still,

3	

3	3	and ventured no farther. The straw, however, began to burn, broke in

3	

3	3	two pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed

3	

3	3	when she got into the water, and breathed her last. The bean, who had

3	

3	3	prudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event,

3	

3	3	was unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst. It would

3	

3	3	have been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who

3	

3	3	was travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook.

3	

3	3	As he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread,

3	

3	3	and sewed her together. The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the

3	

3	3	tailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	BRIAR ROSE

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	A king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way off,

3	

3	3	where there were in those days fairies. Now this king and queen had

3	

3	3	plenty of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of

3	

3	3	good things to eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day: but

3	

3	3	though they had been married many years they had no children, and this

3	

3	3	grieved them very much indeed. But one day as the queen was walking

3	

3	3	by the side of the river, at the bottom of the garden, she saw a poor

3	

3	3	little fish, that had thrown itself out of the water, and lay gasping

3	

3	3	and nearly dead on the bank. Then the queen took pity on the little

3	

3	3	fish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away

3	

3	3	it lifted its head out of the water and said, ‘I know what your wish is,

3	

3	3	and it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me--you will

3	

3	3	soon have a daughter.’ What the little fish had foretold soon came to

3	

3	3	pass; and the queen had a little girl, so very beautiful that the king

3	

3	3	could not cease looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great

3	

3	3	feast and make merry, and show the child to all the land. So he asked

3	

3	3	his kinsmen, and nobles, and friends, and neighbours. But the queen

3	

3	3	said, ‘I will have the fairies also, that they might be kind and good

3	

3	3	to our little daughter.’ Now there were thirteen fairies in the kingdom;

3	

3	3	but as the king and queen had only twelve golden dishes for them to eat

3	

3	3	out of, they were forced to leave one of the fairies without asking her.

3	

3	3	So twelve fairies came, each with a high red cap on her head, and red

3	

3	3	shoes with high heels on her feet, and a long white wand in her hand:

3	

3	3	and after the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave all

3	

3	3	their best gifts to the little princess. One gave her goodness, another

3	

3	3	beauty, another riches, and so on till she had all that was good in the

3	

3	3	world.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Just as eleven of them had done blessing her, a great noise was heard in

3	

3	3	the courtyard, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was

3	

3	3	come, with a black cap on her head, and black shoes on her feet, and a

3	

3	3	broomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the dining-hall.

3	

3	3	Now, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and

3	

3	3	scolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her

3	

3	3	revenge. So she cried out, ‘The king’s daughter shall, in her fifteenth

3	

3	3	year, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.’ Then the twelfth of

3	

3	3	the friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift, came forward, and

3	

3	3	said that the evil wish must be fulfilled, but that she could soften its

3	

3	3	mischief; so her gift was, that the king’s daughter, when the spindle

3	

3	3	wounded her, should not really die, but should only fall asleep for a

3	

3	3	hundred years.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	However, the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from

3	

3	3	the threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom

3	

3	3	should be bought up and burnt. But all the gifts of the first eleven

3	

3	3	fairies were in the meantime fulfilled; for the princess was so

3	

3	3	beautiful, and well behaved, and good, and wise, that everyone who knew

3	

3	3	her loved her.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	It happened that, on the very day she was fifteen years old, the king

3	

3	3	and queen were not at home, and she was left alone in the palace. So she

3	

3	3	roved about by herself, and looked at all the rooms and chambers, till

3	

3	3	at last she came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow staircase

3	

3	3	ending with a little door. In the door there was a golden key, and when

3	

3	3	she turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning

3	

3	3	away very busily. ‘Why, how now, good mother,’ said the princess; ‘what

3	

3	3	are you doing there?’ ‘Spinning,’ said the old lady, and nodded her

3	

3	3	head, humming a tune, while buzz! went the wheel. ‘How prettily that

3	

3	3	little thing turns round!’ said the princess, and took the spindle

3	

3	3	and began to try and spin. But scarcely had she touched it, before the

3	

3	3	fairy’s prophecy was fulfilled; the spindle wounded her, and she fell

3	

3	3	down lifeless on the ground.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	However, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and

3	

3	3	the king and the queen, who had just come home, and all their court,

3	

3	3	fell asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in

3	

3	3	the court, the pigeons on the house-top, and the very flies slept upon

3	

3	3	the walls. Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went to

3	

3	3	sleep; the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a

3	

3	3	goose upon it for the king’s dinner stood still; and the cook, who was

3	

3	3	at that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box

3	

3	3	on the ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell

3	

3	3	asleep; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the

3	

3	3	jug at his lips: and thus everything stood still, and slept soundly.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	A large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace, and every year it

3	

3	3	became higher and thicker; till at last the old palace was surrounded

3	

3	3	and hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen. But

3	

3	3	there went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping Briar

3	

3	3	Rose (for so the king’s daughter was called): so that, from time to

3	

3	3	time, several kings’ sons came, and tried to break through the thicket

3	

3	3	into the palace. This, however, none of them could ever do; for the

3	

3	3	thorns and bushes laid hold of them, as it were with hands; and there

3	

3	3	they stuck fast, and died wretchedly.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	After many, many years there came a king’s son into that land: and an

3	

3	3	old man told him the story of the thicket of thorns; and how a beautiful

3	

3	3	palace stood behind it, and how a wonderful princess, called Briar Rose,

3	

3	3	lay in it asleep, with all her court. He told, too, how he had heard

3	

3	3	from his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had tried to

3	

3	3	break through the thicket, but that they had all stuck fast in it, and

3	

3	3	died. Then the young prince said, ‘All this shall not frighten me; I

3	

3	3	will go and see this Briar Rose.’ The old man tried to hinder him, but

3	

3	3	he was bent upon going.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Now that very day the hundred years were ended; and as the prince came

3	

3	3	to the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs, through

3	

3	3	which he went with ease, and they shut in after him as thick as ever.

3	

3	3	Then he came at last to the palace, and there in the court lay the dogs

3	

3	3	asleep; and the horses were standing in the stables; and on the roof sat

3	

3	3	the pigeons fast asleep, with their heads under their wings. And when he

3	

3	3	came into the palace, the flies were sleeping on the walls; the spit

3	

3	3	was standing still; the butler had the jug of ale at his lips, going

3	

3	3	to drink a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to be

3	

3	3	plucked; and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand, as

3	

3	3	if she was going to beat the boy.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then he went on still farther, and all was so still that he could hear

3	

3	3	every breath he drew; till at last he came to the old tower, and opened

3	

3	3	the door of the little room in which Briar Rose was; and there she lay,

3	

3	3	fast asleep on a couch by the window. She looked so beautiful that he

3	

3	3	could not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.

3	

3	3	But the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled

3	

3	3	upon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also

3	

3	3	awoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder.

3	

3	3	And the horses shook themselves, and the dogs jumped up and barked; the

3	

3	3	pigeons took their heads from under their wings, and looked about and

3	

3	3	flew into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in

3	

3	3	the kitchen blazed up; round went the jack, and round went the spit,

3	

3	3	with the goose for the king’s dinner upon it; the butler finished his

3	

3	3	draught of ale; the maid went on plucking the fowl; and the cook gave

3	

3	3	the boy the box on his ear.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And then the prince and Briar Rose were married, and the wedding feast

3	

3	3	was given; and they lived happily together all their lives long.

3

3	

3	3	THE DOG AND THE SPARROW

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	A shepherd’s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him

3	

3	3	suffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he

3	

3	3	took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood.

3	

3	3	On the road he met a sparrow that said to him, ‘Why are you so sad,

3	

3	3	my friend?’ ‘Because,’ said the dog, ‘I am very very hungry, and have

3	

3	3	nothing to eat.’ ‘If that be all,’ answered the sparrow, ‘come with me

3	

3	3	into the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.’ So on they

3	

3	3	went together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher’s shop,

3	

3	3	the sparrow said to the dog, ‘Stand there a little while till I peck you

3	

3	3	down a piece of meat.’ So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having

3	

3	3	first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she

3	

3	3	pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf,

3	

3	3	till at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up, and scrambled

3	

3	3	away with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up. ‘Well,’ said

3	

3	3	the sparrow, ‘you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to

3	

3	3	the next shop, and I will peck you down another steak.’ When the dog had

3	

3	3	eaten this too, the sparrow said to him, ‘Well, my good friend, have you

3	

3	3	had enough now?’ ‘I have had plenty of meat,’ answered he, ‘but I should

3	

3	3	like to have a piece of bread to eat after it.’ ‘Come with me then,’

3	

3	3	said the sparrow, ‘and you shall soon have that too.’ So she took him

3	

3	3	to a baker’s shop, and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window, till

3	

3	3	they fell down: and as the dog still wished for more, she took him to

3	

3	3	another shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten, the

3	

3	3	sparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. ‘Yes,’ said he; ‘and

3	

3	3	now let us take a walk a little way out of the town.’ So they both went

3	

3	3	out upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone

3	

3	3	far before the dog said, ‘I am very much tired--I should like to take a

3	

3	3	nap.’ ‘Very well,’ answered the sparrow, ‘do so, and in the meantime

3	

3	3	I will perch upon that bush.’ So the dog stretched himself out on the

3	

3	3	road, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with

3	

3	3	a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. The

3	

3	3	sparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would

3	

3	3	go on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called

3	

3	3	out, ‘Stop! stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.’ But the

3	

3	3	carter, grumbling to himself, ‘You make it the worse for me, indeed!

3	

3	3	what can you do?’ cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor

3	

3	3	dog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. ‘There,’ cried the

3	

3	3	sparrow, ‘thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now

3	

3	3	mind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.’

3	

3	3	‘Do your worst, and welcome,’ said the brute, ‘what harm can you do me?’

3	

3	3	and passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and

3	

3	3	pecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and then

3	

3	3	all the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it. At last he looked

3	

3	3	round, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty.

3	

3	3	‘What an unlucky wretch I am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said

3	

3	3	the sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses, and

3	

3	3	pecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the carter saw this,

3	

3	3	he drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill

3	

3	3	her; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horse’s head

3	

3	3	with such force, that he fell down dead. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’

3	

3	3	cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the sparrow. And as the carter

3	

3	3	went on with the other two horses, she again crept under the tilt of the

3	

3	3	cart, and pecked out the bung of the second cask, so that all the wine

3	

3	3	ran out. When the carter saw this, he again cried out, ‘Miserable wretch

3	

3	3	that I am!’ But the sparrow answered, ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ and

3	

3	3	perched on the head of the second horse, and pecked at him too. The

3	

3	3	carter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she

3	

3	3	flew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the

3	

3	3	spot. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ said he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said

3	

3	3	the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him

3	

3	3	too. The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or

3	

3	3	caring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his

3	

3	3	third horse as he done the other two. ‘Alas! miserable wretch that I

3	

3	3	am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ answered the sparrow as she flew

3	

3	3	away; ‘now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.’ The

3	

3	3	carter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home

3	

3	3	overflowing with rage and vexation. ‘Alas!’ said he to his wife, ‘what

3	

3	3	ill luck has befallen me!--my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three

3	

3	3	dead.’ ‘Alas! husband,’ replied she, ‘and a wicked bird has come into

3	

3	3	the house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am

3	

3	3	sure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it

3	

3	3	up at such a rate!’ Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of

3	

3	3	birds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the

3	

3	3	midst of them. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ cried the carter; for he saw

3	

3	3	that the corn was almost all gone. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the

3	

3	3	sparrow; ‘thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life yet!’ and away she flew.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down

3	

3	3	into his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat

3	

3	3	himself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow sat

3	

3	3	on the outside of the window, and cried ‘Carter! thy cruelty shall cost

3	

3	3	thee thy life!’ With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet,

3	

3	3	and threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the

3	

3	3	window. The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window-seat, and

3	

3	3	cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!’ Then he became mad and

3	

3	3	blind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he

3	

3	3	cleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter

3	

3	3	and his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture,

3	

3	3	glasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without

3	

3	3	touching the bird at all. In the end, however, they caught her: and the

3	

3	3	wife said, ‘Shall I kill her at once?’ ‘No,’ cried he, ‘that is letting

3	

3	3	her off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat

3	

3	3	her.’ But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck

3	

3	3	and cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!’ With that he

3	

3	3	could wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, ‘Wife,

3	

3	3	strike at the bird and kill her in my hand.’ And the wife struck; but

3	

3	3	she missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down

3	

3	3	dead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.

3

3	

3	3	THE TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSES

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There was a king who had twelve beautiful daughters. They slept in

3	

3	3	twelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were

3	

3	3	shut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be quite

3	

3	3	worn through as if they had been danced in all night; and yet nobody

3	

3	3	could find out how it happened, or where they had been.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the king made it known to all the land, that if any person could

3	

3	3	discover the secret, and find out where it was that the princesses

3	

3	3	danced in the night, he should have the one he liked best for his

3	

3	3	wife, and should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did not

3	

3	3	succeed, after three days and nights, should be put to death.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	A king’s son soon came. He was well entertained, and in the evening was

3	

3	3	taken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their

3	

3	3	twelve beds. There he was to sit and watch where they went to dance;

3	

3	3	and, in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it, the door

3	

3	3	of his chamber was left open. But the king’s son soon fell asleep; and

3	

3	3	when he awoke in the morning he found that the princesses had all been

3	

3	3	dancing, for the soles of their shoes were full of holes. The same thing

3	

3	3	happened the second and third night: so the king ordered his head to be

3	

3	3	cut off. After him came several others; but they had all the same luck,

3	

3	3	and all lost their lives in the same manner.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Now it chanced that an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle

3	

3	3	and could fight no longer, passed through the country where this king

3	

3	3	reigned: and as he was travelling through a wood, he met an old woman,

3	

3	3	who asked him where he was going. ‘I hardly know where I am going, or

3	

3	3	what I had better do,’ said the soldier; ‘but I think I should like very

3	

3	3	well to find out where it is that the princesses dance, and then in time

3	

3	3	I might be a king.’ ‘Well,’ said the old dame, ‘that is no very hard

3	

3	3	task: only take care not to drink any of the wine which one of the

3	

3	3	princesses will bring to you in the evening; and as soon as she leaves

3	

3	3	you pretend to be fast asleep.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then she gave him a cloak, and said, ‘As soon as you put that on

3	

3	3	you will become invisible, and you will then be able to follow the

3	

3	3	princesses wherever they go.’ When the soldier heard all this good

3	

3	3	counsel, he determined to try his luck: so he went to the king, and said

3	

3	3	he was willing to undertake the task.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	He was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered

3	

3	3	fine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led

3	

3	3	to the outer chamber. Just as he was going to lie down, the eldest of

3	

3	3	the princesses brought him a cup of wine; but the soldier threw it all

3	

3	3	away secretly, taking care not to drink a drop. Then he laid himself

3	

3	3	down on his bed, and in a little while began to snore very loud as if

3	

3	3	he was fast asleep. When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed

3	

3	3	heartily; and the eldest said, ‘This fellow too might have done a wiser

3	

3	3	thing than lose his life in this way!’ Then they rose up and opened

3	

3	3	their drawers and boxes, and took out all their fine clothes, and

3	

3	3	dressed themselves at the glass, and skipped about as if they were eager

3	

3	3	to begin dancing. But the youngest said, ‘I don’t know how it is, while

3	

3	3	you are so happy I feel very uneasy; I am sure some mischance will

3	

3	3	befall us.’ ‘You simpleton,’ said the eldest, ‘you are always afraid;

3	

3	3	have you forgotten how many kings’ sons have already watched in vain?

3	

3	3	And as for this soldier, even if I had not given him his sleeping

3	

3	3	draught, he would have slept soundly enough.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When they were all ready, they went and looked at the soldier; but he

3	

3	3	snored on, and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were

3	

3	3	quite safe; and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands,

3	

3	3	and the bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open. The soldier

3	

3	3	saw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest

3	

3	3	leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put

3	

3	3	on the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them;

3	

3	3	but in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest

3	

3	3	princess, and she cried out to her sisters, ‘All is not right; someone

3	

3	3	took hold of my gown.’ ‘You silly creature!’ said the eldest, ‘it is

3	

3	3	nothing but a nail in the wall.’ Then down they all went, and at the

3	

3	3	bottom they found themselves in a most delightful grove of trees; and

3	

3	3	the leaves were all of silver, and glittered and sparkled beautifully.

3	

3	3	The soldier wished to take away some token of the place; so he broke

3	

3	3	off a little branch, and there came a loud noise from the tree. Then the

3	

3	3	youngest daughter said again, ‘I am sure all is not right--did not you

3	

3	3	hear that noise? That never happened before.’ But the eldest said, ‘It

3	

3	3	is only our princes, who are shouting for joy at our approach.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then they came to another grove of trees, where all the leaves were of

3	

3	3	gold; and afterwards to a third, where the leaves were all glittering

3	

3	3	diamonds. And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there

3	

3	3	was a loud noise, which made the youngest sister tremble with fear; but

3	

3	3	the eldest still said, it was only the princes, who were crying for joy.

3	

3	3	So they went on till they came to a great lake; and at the side of the

3	

3	3	lake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in them,

3	

3	3	who seemed to be waiting there for the princesses.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	One of the princesses went into each boat, and the soldier stepped into

3	

3	3	the same boat with the youngest. As they were rowing over the lake, the

3	

3	3	prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier

3	

3	3	said, ‘I do not know why it is, but though I am rowing with all my might

3	

3	3	we do not get on so fast as usual, and I am quite tired: the boat

3	

3	3	seems very heavy today.’ ‘It is only the heat of the weather,’ said the

3	

3	3	princess: ‘I feel it very warm too.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	On the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated castle, from

3	

3	3	which came the merry music of horns and trumpets. There they all landed,

3	

3	3	and went into the castle, and each prince danced with his princess; and

3	

3	3	the soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with them too; and

3	

3	3	when any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her, he drank it

3	

3	3	all up, so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty. At this,

3	

3	3	too, the youngest sister was terribly frightened, but the eldest always

3	

3	3	silenced her. They danced on till three o’clock in the morning, and then

3	

3	3	all their shoes were worn out, so that they were obliged to leave off.

3	

3	3	The princes rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the

3	

3	3	soldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the

3	

3	3	opposite shore they took leave of each other, the princesses promising

3	

3	3	to come again the next night.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When they came to the stairs, the soldier ran on before the princesses,

3	

3	3	and laid himself down; and as the twelve sisters slowly came up very

3	

3	3	much tired, they heard him snoring in his bed; so they said, ‘Now all

3	

3	3	is quite safe’; then they undressed themselves, put away their fine

3	

3	3	clothes, pulled off their shoes, and went to bed. In the morning the

3	

3	3	soldier said nothing about what had happened, but determined to see more

3	

3	3	of this strange adventure, and went again the second and third night;

3	

3	3	and every thing happened just as before; the princesses danced each time

3	

3	3	till their shoes were worn to pieces, and then returned home. However,

3	

3	3	on the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a

3	

3	3	token of where he had been.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	As soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret, he was taken

3	

3	3	before the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the

3	

3	3	twelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would

3	

3	3	say. And when the king asked him. ‘Where do my twelve daughters dance at

3	

3	3	night?’ he answered, ‘With twelve princes in a castle under ground.’ And

3	

3	3	then he told the king all that had happened, and showed him the three

3	

3	3	branches and the golden cup which he had brought with him. Then the king

3	

3	3	called for the princesses, and asked them whether what the soldier said

3	

3	3	was true: and when they saw that they were discovered, and that it was

3	

3	3	of no use to deny what had happened, they confessed it all. And the king

3	

3	3	asked the soldier which of them he would choose for his wife; and he

3	

3	3	answered, ‘I am not very young, so I will have the eldest.’--And they

3	

3	3	were married that very day, and the soldier was chosen to be the king’s

3	

3	3	heir.

3	

3	3	THE FISHERMAN AND HIS WIFE

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close

3	

3	3	by the seaside. The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing; and

3	

3	3	one day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the sparkling

3	

3	3	waves and watching his line, all on a sudden his float was dragged away

3	

3	3	deep into the water: and in drawing it up he pulled out a great fish.

3	

3	3	But the fish said, ‘Pray let me live! I am not a real fish; I am an

3	

3	3	enchanted prince: put me in the water again, and let me go!’ ‘Oh, ho!’

3	

3	3	said the man, ‘you need not make so many words about the matter; I will

3	

3	3	have nothing to do with a fish that can talk: so swim away, sir, as soon

3	

3	3	as you please!’ Then he put him back into the water, and the fish darted

3	

3	3	straight down to the bottom, and left a long streak of blood behind him

3	

3	3	on the wave.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When the fisherman went home to his wife in the pigsty, he told her how

3	

3	3	he had caught a great fish, and how it had told him it was an enchanted

3	

3	3	prince, and how, on hearing it speak, he had let it go again. ‘Did not

3	

3	3	you ask it for anything?’ said the wife, ‘we live very wretchedly here,

3	

3	3	in this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the fish we want a snug

3	

3	3	little cottage.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The fisherman did not much like the business: however, he went to the

3	

3	3	seashore; and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and

3	

3	3	green. And he stood at the water’s edge, and said:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘O man of the sea!

3	

3	3	  Hearken to me!

3	

3	3	  My wife Ilsabill

3	

3	3	  Will have her own will,

3	

3	3	  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the fish came swimming to him, and said, ‘Well, what is her will?

3	

3	3	What does your wife want?’ ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘she says that when

3	

3	3	I had caught you, I ought to have asked you for something before I let

3	

3	3	you go; she does not like living any longer in the pigsty, and wants

3	

3	3	a snug little cottage.’ ‘Go home, then,’ said the fish; ‘she is in the

3	

3	3	cottage already!’ So the man went home, and saw his wife standing at the

3	

3	3	door of a nice trim little cottage. ‘Come in, come in!’ said she; ‘is

3	

3	3	not this much better than the filthy pigsty we had?’ And there was a

3	

3	3	parlour, and a bedchamber, and a kitchen; and behind the cottage there

3	

3	3	was a little garden, planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits; and

3	

3	3	there was a courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens. ‘Ah!’ said the

3	

3	3	fisherman, ‘how happily we shall live now!’ ‘We will try to do so, at

3	

3	3	least,’ said his wife.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Everything went right for a week or two, and then Dame Ilsabill said,

3	

3	3	‘Husband, there is not near room enough for us in this cottage; the

3	

3	3	courtyard and the garden are a great deal too small; I should like to

3	

3	3	have a large stone castle to live in: go to the fish again and tell him

3	

3	3	to give us a castle.’ ‘Wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘I don’t like to go to

3	

3	3	him again, for perhaps he will be angry; we ought to be easy with this

3	

3	3	pretty cottage to live in.’ ‘Nonsense!’ said the wife; ‘he will do it

3	

3	3	very willingly, I know; go along and try!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy: and when he came to

3	

3	3	the sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was very calm; and he went

3	

3	3	close to the edge of the waves, and said:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘O man of the sea!

3	

3	3	  Hearken to me!

3	

3	3	  My wife Ilsabill

3	

3	3	  Will have her own will,

3	

3	3	  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Well, what does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the man,

3	

3	3	dolefully, ‘my wife wants to live in a stone castle.’ ‘Go home, then,’

3	

3	3	said the fish; ‘she is standing at the gate of it already.’ So away went

3	

3	3	the fisherman, and found his wife standing before the gate of a great

3	

3	3	castle. ‘See,’ said she, ‘is not this grand?’ With that they went into

3	

3	3	the castle together, and found a great many servants there, and the

3	

3	3	rooms all richly furnished, and full of golden chairs and tables; and

3	

3	3	behind the castle was a garden, and around it was a park half a

3	

3	3	mile long, full of sheep, and goats, and hares, and deer; and in the

3	

3	3	courtyard were stables and cow-houses. ‘Well,’ said the man, ‘now we

3	

3	3	will live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of

3	

3	3	our lives.’ ‘Perhaps we may,’ said the wife; ‘but let us sleep upon it,

3	

3	3	before we make up our minds to that.’ So they went to bed.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The next morning when Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight, and

3	

3	3	she jogged the fisherman with her elbow, and said, ‘Get up, husband,

3	

3	3	and bestir yourself, for we must be king of all the land.’ ‘Wife, wife,’

3	

3	3	said the man, ‘why should we wish to be the king? I will not be king.’

3	

3	3	‘Then I will,’ said she. ‘But, wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘how can you

3	

3	3	be king--the fish cannot make you a king?’ ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘say

3	

3	3	no more about it, but go and try! I will be king.’ So the man went away

3	

3	3	quite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king. This time

3	

3	3	the sea looked a dark grey colour, and was overspread with curling waves

3	

3	3	and the ridges of foam as he cried out:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘O man of the sea!

3	

3	3	  Hearken to me!

3	

3	3	  My wife Ilsabill

3	

3	3	  Will have her own will,

3	

3	3	  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Well, what would she have now?’ said the fish. ‘Alas!’ said the poor

3	

3	3	man, ‘my wife wants to be king.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is king

3	

3	3	already.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace he saw

3	

3	3	a troop of soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and trumpets. And when

3	

3	3	he went in he saw his wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamonds,

3	

3	3	with a golden crown upon her head; and on each side of her stood six

3	

3	3	fair maidens, each a head taller than the other. ‘Well, wife,’ said the

3	

3	3	fisherman, ‘are you king?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am king.’ And when he had

3	

3	3	looked at her for a long time, he said, ‘Ah, wife! what a fine thing it

3	

3	3	is to be king! Now we shall never have anything more to wish for as long

3	

3	3	as we live.’ ‘I don’t know how that may be,’ said she; ‘never is a long

3	

3	3	time. I am king, it is true; but I begin to be tired of that, and I

3	

3	3	think I should like to be emperor.’ ‘Alas, wife! why should you wish to

3	

3	3	be emperor?’ said the fisherman. ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘go to the fish!

3	

3	3	I say I will be emperor.’ ‘Ah, wife!’ replied the fisherman, ‘the fish

3	

3	3	cannot make an emperor, I am sure, and I should not like to ask him for

3	

3	3	such a thing.’ ‘I am king,’ said Ilsabill, ‘and you are my slave; so go

3	

3	3	at once!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	So the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along,

3	

3	3	‘This will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will be

3	

3	3	tired at last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done.’ He

3	

3	3	soon came to the seashore; and the water was quite black and muddy, and

3	

3	3	a mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about, but he

3	

3	3	went as near as he could to the water’s brink, and said:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘O man of the sea!

3	

3	3	  Hearken to me!

3	

3	3	  My wife Ilsabill

3	

3	3	  Will have her own will,

3	

3	3	  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘What would she have now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman,

3	

3	3	‘she wants to be emperor.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is emperor

3	

3	3	already.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	So he went home again; and as he came near he saw his wife Ilsabill

3	

3	3	sitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great crown on

3	

3	3	her head full two yards high; and on each side of her stood her guards

3	

3	3	and attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other, from the

3	

3	3	tallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger. And

3	

3	3	before her stood princes, and dukes, and earls: and the fisherman went

3	

3	3	up to her and said, ‘Wife, are you emperor?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am

3	

3	3	emperor.’ ‘Ah!’ said the man, as he gazed upon her, ‘what a fine thing

3	

3	3	it is to be emperor!’ ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘why should we stop at being

3	

3	3	emperor? I will be pope next.’ ‘O wife, wife!’ said he, ‘how can you be

3	

3	3	pope? there is but one pope at a time in Christendom.’ ‘Husband,’ said

3	

3	3	she, ‘I will be pope this very day.’ ‘But,’ replied the husband, ‘the

3	

3	3	fish cannot make you pope.’ ‘What nonsense!’ said she; ‘if he can make

3	

3	3	an emperor, he can make a pope: go and try him.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	So the fisherman went. But when he came to the shore the wind was raging

3	

3	3	and the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves, and the ships were

3	

3	3	in trouble, and rolled fearfully upon the tops of the billows. In the

3	

3	3	middle of the heavens there was a little piece of blue sky, but towards

3	

3	3	the south all was red, as if a dreadful storm was rising. At this sight

3	

3	3	the fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he trembled so that his

3	

3	3	knees knocked together: but still he went down near to the shore, and

3	

3	3	said:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘O man of the sea!

3	

3	3	  Hearken to me!

3	

3	3	  My wife Ilsabill

3	

3	3	  Will have her own will,

3	

3	3	  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘What does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘my

3	

3	3	wife wants to be pope.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is pope already.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the fisherman went home, and found Ilsabill sitting on a throne

3	

3	3	that was two miles high. And she had three great crowns on her head, and

3	

3	3	around her stood all the pomp and power of the Church. And on each side

3	

3	3	of her were two rows of burning lights, of all sizes, the greatest as

3	

3	3	large as the highest and biggest tower in the world, and the least no

3	

3	3	larger than a small rushlight. ‘Wife,’ said the fisherman, as he looked

3	

3	3	at all this greatness, ‘are you pope?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am pope.’

3	

3	3	‘Well, wife,’ replied he, ‘it is a grand thing to be pope; and now

3	

3	3	you must be easy, for you can be nothing greater.’ ‘I will think about

3	

3	3	that,’ said the wife. Then they went to bed: but Dame Ilsabill could not

3	

3	3	sleep all night for thinking what she should be next. At last, as she

3	

3	3	was dropping asleep, morning broke, and the sun rose. ‘Ha!’ thought she,

3	

3	3	as she woke up and looked at it through the window, ‘after all I cannot

3	

3	3	prevent the sun rising.’ At this thought she was very angry, and wakened

3	

3	3	her husband, and said, ‘Husband, go to the fish and tell him I must

3	

3	3	be lord of the sun and moon.’ The fisherman was half asleep, but the

3	

3	3	thought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed.

3	

3	3	‘Alas, wife!’ said he, ‘cannot you be easy with being pope?’ ‘No,’

3	

3	3	said she, ‘I am very uneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without my

3	

3	3	leave. Go to the fish at once!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the man went shivering with fear; and as he was going down to

3	

3	3	the shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks

3	

3	3	shook. And all the heavens became black with stormy clouds, and the

3	

3	3	lightnings played, and the thunders rolled; and you might have seen in

3	

3	3	the sea great black waves, swelling up like mountains with crowns of

3	

3	3	white foam upon their heads. And the fisherman crept towards the sea,

3	

3	3	and cried out, as well as he could:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘O man of the sea!

3	

3	3	  Hearken to me!

3	

3	3	  My wife Ilsabill

3	

3	3	  Will have her own will,

3	

3	3	  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘What does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said he, ‘she wants to

3	

3	3	be lord of the sun and moon.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish, ‘to your pigsty

3	

3	3	again.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And there they live to this very day.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	THE WILLOW-WREN AND THE BEAR

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Once in summer-time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest,

3	

3	3	and the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said: ‘Brother

3	

3	3	wolf, what bird is it that sings so well?’ ‘That is the King of birds,’

3	

3	3	said the wolf, ‘before whom we must bow down.’ In reality the bird was

3	

3	3	the willow-wren. ‘IF that’s the case,’ said the bear, ‘I should very

3	

3	3	much like to see his royal palace; come, take me thither.’ ‘That is not

3	

3	3	done quite as you seem to think,’ said the wolf; ‘you must wait until

3	

3	3	the Queen comes,’ Soon afterwards, the Queen arrived with some food in

3	

3	3	her beak, and the lord King came too, and they began to feed their young

3	

3	3	ones. The bear would have liked to go at once, but the wolf held him

3	

3	3	back by the sleeve, and said: ‘No, you must wait until the lord and lady

3	

3	3	Queen have gone away again.’ So they took stock of the hole where the

3	

3	3	nest lay, and trotted away. The bear, however, could not rest until he

3	

3	3	had seen the royal palace, and when a short time had passed, went to it

3	

3	3	again. The King and Queen had just flown out, so he peeped in and saw

3	

3	3	five or six young ones lying there. ‘Is that the royal palace?’ cried

3	

3	3	the bear; ‘it is a wretched palace, and you are not King’s children, you

3	

3	3	are disreputable children!’ When the young wrens heard that, they were

3	

3	3	frightfully angry, and screamed: ‘No, that we are not! Our parents are

3	

3	3	honest people! Bear, you will have to pay for that!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their

3	

3	3	holes. The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream, and

3	

3	3	when their parents again brought food they said: ‘We will not so much as

3	

3	3	touch one fly’s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have

3	

3	3	settled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been

3	

3	3	here and has insulted us!’ Then the old King said: ‘Be easy, he shall

3	

3	3	be punished,’ and he at once flew with the Queen to the bear’s cave, and

3	

3	3	called in: ‘Old Growler, why have you insulted my children? You shall

3	

3	3	suffer for it--we will punish you by a bloody war.’ Thus war was

3	

3	3	announced to the Bear, and all four-footed animals were summoned to take

3	

3	3	part in it, oxen, asses, cows, deer, and every other animal the earth

3	

3	3	contained. And the willow-wren summoned everything which flew in the

3	

3	3	air, not only birds, large and small, but midges, and hornets, bees and

3	

3	3	flies had to come.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When the time came for the war to begin, the willow-wren sent out spies

3	

3	3	to discover who was the enemy’s commander-in-chief. The gnat, who was

3	

3	3	the most crafty, flew into the forest where the enemy was assembled,

3	

3	3	and hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the password was to be

3	

3	3	announced. There stood the bear, and he called the fox before him

3	

3	3	and said: ‘Fox, you are the most cunning of all animals, you shall be

3	

3	3	general and lead us.’ ‘Good,’ said the fox, ‘but what signal shall we

3	

3	3	agree upon?’ No one knew that, so the fox said: ‘I have a fine long

3	

3	3	bushy tail, which almost looks like a plume of red feathers. When I lift

3	

3	3	my tail up quite high, all is going well, and you must charge; but if I

3	

3	3	let it hang down, run away as fast as you can.’ When the gnat had heard

3	

3	3	that, she flew away again, and revealed everything, down to the minutest

3	

3	3	detail, to the willow-wren. When day broke, and the battle was to begin,

3	

3	3	all the four-footed animals came running up with such a noise that the

3	

3	3	earth trembled. The willow-wren with his army also came flying through

3	

3	3	the air with such a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one

3	

3	3	was uneasy and afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each

3	

3	3	other. But the willow-wren sent down the hornet, with orders to settle

3	

3	3	beneath the fox’s tail, and sting with all his might. When the fox felt

3	

3	3	the first string, he started so that he lifted one leg, from pain, but

3	

3	3	he bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second

3	

3	3	sting, he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could

3	

3	3	hold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail between his legs. When

3	

3	3	the animals saw that, they thought all was lost, and began to flee, each

3	

3	3	into his hole, and the birds had won the battle.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the King and Queen flew home to their children and cried:

3	

3	3	‘Children, rejoice, eat and drink to your heart’s content, we have won

3	

3	3	the battle!’ But the young wrens said: ‘We will not eat yet, the bear

3	

3	3	must come to the nest, and beg for pardon and say that we are honourable

3	

3	3	children, before we will do that.’ Then the willow-wren flew to the

3	

3	3	bear’s hole and cried: ‘Growler, you are to come to the nest to my

3	

3	3	children, and beg their pardon, or else every rib of your body shall

3	

3	3	be broken.’ So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear, and begged

3	

3	3	their pardon. And now at last the young wrens were satisfied, and sat

3	

3	3	down together and ate and drank, and made merry till quite late into the

3	

3	3	night.

3

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	THE FROG-PRINCE

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went

3	

3	3	out to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool

3	

3	3	spring of water, that rose in the midst of it, she sat herself down

3	

3	3	to rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her

3	

3	3	favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and

3	

3	3	catching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high that

3	

3	3	she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled

3	

3	3	along upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring. The

3	

3	3	princess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so

3	

3	3	deep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she began to bewail

3	

3	3	her loss, and said, ‘Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would

3	

3	3	give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the

3	

3	3	world.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Whilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said,

3	

3	3	‘Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘what can you

3	

3	3	do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.’

3	

3	3	The frog said, ‘I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes;

3	

3	3	but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off

3	

3	3	your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball

3	

3	3	again.’ ‘What nonsense,’ thought the princess, ‘this silly frog is

3	

3	3	talking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though

3	

3	3	he may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he

3	

3	3	shall have what he asks.’ So she said to the frog, ‘Well, if you will

3	

3	3	bring me my ball, I will do all you ask.’ Then the frog put his head

3	

3	3	down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came

3	

3	3	up again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the

3	

3	3	spring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick

3	

3	3	it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she

3	

3	3	never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could.

3	

3	3	The frog called after her, ‘Stay, princess, and take me with you as you

3	

3	3	said,’ But she did not stop to hear a word.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a

3	

3	3	strange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the

3	

3	3	marble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the

3	

3	3	door, and a little voice cried out and said:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,

3	

3	3	  Open the door to thy true love here!

3	

3	3	  And mind the words that thou and I said

3	

3	3	  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw

3	

3	3	the frog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly

3	

3	3	frightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her

3	

3	3	seat. The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her,

3	

3	3	asked her what was the matter. ‘There is a nasty frog,’ said she, ‘at

3	

3	3	the door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: I

3	

3	3	told him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never

3	

3	3	get out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come

3	

3	3	in.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	While she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,

3	

3	3	  Open the door to thy true love here!

3	

3	3	  And mind the words that thou and I said

3	

3	3	  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the king said to the young princess, ‘As you have given your word

3	

3	3	you must keep it; so go and let him in.’ She did so, and the frog hopped

3	

3	3	into the room, and then straight on--tap, tap--plash, plash--from the

3	

3	3	bottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where

3	

3	3	the princess sat. ‘Pray lift me upon chair,’ said he to the princess,

3	

3	3	‘and let me sit next to you.’ As soon as she had done this, the frog

3	

3	3	said, ‘Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.’ This

3	

3	3	she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, ‘Now I am

3	

3	3	tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.’ And the princess,

3	

3	3	though very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the

3	

3	3	pillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was

3	

3	3	light he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house.

3	

3	3	‘Now, then,’ thought the princess, ‘at last he is gone, and I shall be

3	

3	3	troubled with him no more.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same

3	

3	3	tapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,

3	

3	3	  Open the door to thy true love here!

3	

3	3	  And mind the words that thou and I said

3	

3	3	  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon

3	

3	3	her pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he did

3	

3	3	the same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was

3	

3	3	astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her

3	

3	3	with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head

3	

3	3	of her bed.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had

3	

3	3	changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till

3	

3	3	some princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from

3	

3	3	her plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. ‘You,’ said the

3	

3	3	prince, ‘have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for

3	

3	3	but that you should go with me into my father’s kingdom, where I will

3	

3	3	marry you, and love you as long as you live.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying ‘Yes’ to

3	

3	3	all this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful

3	

3	3	horses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind

3	

3	3	the coach rode the prince’s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed

3	

3	3	the misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so

3	

3	3	bitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight

3	

3	3	horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince’s

3	

3	3	kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great

3	

3	3	many years.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	CAT AND MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	A certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much

3	

3	3	to her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at

3	

3	3	length the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.

3	

3	3	‘But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer

3	

3	3	from hunger,’ said the cat; ‘and you, little mouse, cannot venture

3	

3	3	everywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.’ The good advice

3	

3	3	was followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where

3	

3	3	to put it. At length, after much consideration, the cat said: ‘I know no

3	

3	3	place where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one

3	

3	3	dares take anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar,

3	

3	3	and not touch it until we are really in need of it.’ So the pot was

3	

3	3	placed in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great

3	

3	3	yearning for it, and said to the mouse: ‘I want to tell you something,

3	

3	3	little mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has

3	

3	3	asked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold

3	

3	3	him over the font at the christening. Let me go out today, and you look

3	

3	3	after the house by yourself.’ ‘Yes, yes,’ answered the mouse, ‘by all

3	

3	3	means go, and if you get anything very good to eat, think of me. I

3	

3	3	should like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.’ All this,

3	

3	3	however, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to

3	

3	3	be godmother. She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat,

3	

3	3	began to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off. Then she took a

3	

3	3	walk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then

3	

3	3	stretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought

3	

3	3	of the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home.

3	

3	3	‘Well, here you are again,’ said the mouse, ‘no doubt you have had a

3	

3	3	merry day.’ ‘All went off well,’ answered the cat. ‘What name did they

3	

3	3	give the child?’ ‘Top off!’ said the cat quite coolly. ‘Top off!’ cried

3	

3	3	the mouse, ‘that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in

3	

3	3	your family?’ ‘What does that matter,’ said the cat, ‘it is no worse

3	

3	3	than Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Before long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She said to

3	

3	3	the mouse: ‘You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for

3	

3	3	a day alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a

3	

3	3	white ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.’ The good mouse consented,

3	

3	3	but the cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured

3	

3	3	half the pot of fat. ‘Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to

3	

3	3	oneself,’ said she, and was quite satisfied with her day’s work. When

3	

3	3	she went home the mouse inquired: ‘And what was the child christened?’

3	

3	3	‘Half-done,’ answered the cat. ‘Half-done! What are you saying? I

3	

3	3	never heard the name in my life, I’ll wager anything it is not in the

3	

3	3	calendar!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The cat’s mouth soon began to water for some more licking. ‘All good

3	

3	3	things go in threes,’ said she, ‘I am asked to stand godmother again.

3	

3	3	The child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that

3	

3	3	exception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only

3	

3	3	happens once every few years, you will let me go, won’t you?’ ‘Top-off!

3	

3	3	Half-done!’ answered the mouse, ‘they are such odd names, they make me

3	

3	3	very thoughtful.’ ‘You sit at home,’ said the cat, ‘in your dark-grey

3	

3	3	fur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that’s because

3	

3	3	you do not go out in the daytime.’ During the cat’s absence the mouse

3	

3	3	cleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat entirely

3	

3	3	emptied the pot of fat. ‘When everything is eaten up one has some

3	

3	3	peace,’ said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not return

3	

3	3	home till night. The mouse at once asked what name had been given to

3	

3	3	the third child. ‘It will not please you more than the others,’ said the

3	

3	3	cat. ‘He is called All-gone.’ ‘All-gone,’ cried the mouse ‘that is the

3	

3	3	most suspicious name of all! I have never seen it in print. All-gone;

3	

3	3	what can that mean?’ and she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay

3	

3	3	down to sleep.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but

3	

3	3	when the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found

3	

3	3	outside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: ‘Come, cat,

3	

3	3	we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves--we

3	

3	3	shall enjoy that.’ ‘Yes,’ answered the cat, ‘you will enjoy it as much

3	

3	3	as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the

3	

3	3	window.’ They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of

3	

3	3	fat certainly was still in its place, but it was empty. ‘Alas!’ said the

3	

3	3	mouse, ‘now I see what has happened, now it comes to light! You are a true

3	

3	3	friend! You have devoured all when you were standing godmother. First

3	

3	3	top off, then half-done, then--’ ‘Will you hold your tongue,’ cried the

3	

3	3	cat, ‘one word more, and I will eat you too.’ ‘All-gone’ was already on

3	

3	3	the poor mouse’s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang

3	

3	3	on her, seized her, and swallowed her down. Verily, that is the way of

3	

3	3	the world.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	THE GOOSE-GIRL

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The king of a great land died, and left his queen to take care of their

3	

3	3	only child. This child was a daughter, who was very beautiful; and her

3	

3	3	mother loved her dearly, and was very kind to her. And there was a good

3	

3	3	fairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her mother to watch

3	

3	3	over her. When she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived a

3	

3	3	great way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married, she

3	

3	3	got ready to set off on her journey to his country. Then the queen her

3	

3	3	mother, packed up a great many costly things; jewels, and gold, and

3	

3	3	silver; trinkets, fine dresses, and in short everything that became a

3	

3	3	royal bride. And she gave her a waiting-maid to ride with her, and give

3	

3	3	her into the bridegroom’s hands; and each had a horse for the journey.

3	

3	3	Now the princess’s horse was the fairy’s gift, and it was called Falada,

3	

3	3	and could speak.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When the time came for them to set out, the fairy went into her

3	

3	3	bed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair,

3	

3	3	and gave it to the princess, and said, ‘Take care of it, dear child; for

3	

3	3	it is a charm that may be of use to you on the road.’ Then they all took

3	

3	3	a sorrowful leave of the princess; and she put the lock of hair into

3	

3	3	her bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her

3	

3	3	bridegroom’s kingdom.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	One day, as they were riding along by a brook, the princess began to

3	

3	3	feel very thirsty: and she said to her maid, ‘Pray get down, and fetch

3	

3	3	me some water in my golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to

3	

3	3	drink.’ ‘Nay,’ said the maid, ‘if you are thirsty, get off yourself, and

3	

3	3	stoop down by the water and drink; I shall not be your waiting-maid any

3	

3	3	longer.’ Then she was so thirsty that she got down, and knelt over the

3	

3	3	little brook, and drank; for she was frightened, and dared not bring out

3	

3	3	her golden cup; and she wept and said, ‘Alas! what will become of me?’

3	

3	3	And the lock answered her, and said:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,

3	

3	3	  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But the princess was very gentle and meek, so she said nothing to her

3	

3	3	maid’s ill behaviour, but got upon her horse again.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then all rode farther on their journey, till the day grew so warm, and

3	

3	3	the sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel very thirsty again;

3	

3	3	and at last, when they came to a river, she forgot her maid’s rude

3	

3	3	speech, and said, ‘Pray get down, and fetch me some water to drink in

3	

3	3	my golden cup.’ But the maid answered her, and even spoke more haughtily

3	

3	3	than before: ‘Drink if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid.’

3	

3	3	Then the princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse, and lay

3	

3	3	down, and held her head over the running stream, and cried and said,

3	

3	3	‘What will become of me?’ And the lock of hair answered her again:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,

3	

3	3	  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom,

3	

3	3	and floated away with the water. Now she was so frightened that she did

3	

3	3	not see it; but her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew the

3	

3	3	charm; and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power, now that

3	

3	3	she had lost the hair. So when the bride had done drinking, and would

3	

3	3	have got upon Falada again, the maid said, ‘I shall ride upon Falada,

3	

3	3	and you may have my horse instead’; so she was forced to give up her

3	

3	3	horse, and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on her

3	

3	3	maid’s shabby ones.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	At last, as they drew near the end of their journey, this treacherous

3	

3	3	servant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what had

3	

3	3	happened. But Falada saw it all, and marked it well.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the waiting-maid got upon Falada, and the real bride rode upon the

3	

3	3	other horse, and they went on in this way till at last they came to the

3	

3	3	royal court. There was great joy at their coming, and the prince flew to

3	

3	3	meet them, and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the one

3	

3	3	who was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to the royal chamber;

3	

3	3	but the true princess was told to stay in the court below.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Now the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do; so he

3	

3	3	amused himself by sitting at his kitchen window, looking at what was

3	

3	3	going on; and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked very pretty,

3	

3	3	and too delicate for a waiting-maid, he went up into the royal chamber

3	

3	3	to ask the bride who it was she had brought with her, that was thus left

3	

3	3	standing in the court below. ‘I brought her with me for the sake of her

3	

3	3	company on the road,’ said she; ‘pray give the girl some work to do,

3	

3	3	that she may not be idle.’ The old king could not for some time think

3	

3	3	of any work for her to do; but at last he said, ‘I have a lad who takes

3	

3	3	care of my geese; she may go and help him.’ Now the name of this lad,

3	

3	3	that the real bride was to help in watching the king’s geese, was

3	

3	3	Curdken.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But the false bride said to the prince, ‘Dear husband, pray do me one

3	

3	3	piece of kindness.’ ‘That I will,’ said the prince. ‘Then tell one of

3	

3	3	your slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon, for it

3	

3	3	was very unruly, and plagued me sadly on the road’; but the truth was,

3	

3	3	she was very much afraid lest Falada should some day or other speak, and

3	

3	3	tell all she had done to the princess. She carried her point, and the

3	

3	3	faithful Falada was killed; but when the true princess heard of it, she

3	

3	3	wept, and begged the man to nail up Falada’s head against a large

3	

3	3	dark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every morning

3	

3	3	and evening, that there she might still see him sometimes. Then the

3	

3	3	slaughterer said he would do as she wished; and cut off the head, and

3	

3	3	nailed it up under the dark gate.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Early the next morning, as she and Curdken went out through the gate,

3	

3	3	she said sorrowfully:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	and the head answered:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!

3	

3	3	  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,

3	

3	3	  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then they went out of the city, and drove the geese on. And when she

3	

3	3	came to the meadow, she sat down upon a bank there, and let down her

3	

3	3	waving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver; and when Curdken

3	

3	3	saw it glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have pulled some of the

3	

3	3	locks out, but she cried:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Blow, breezes, blow!

3	

3	3	  Let Curdken’s hat go!

3	

3	3	  Blow, breezes, blow!

3	

3	3	  Let him after it go!

3	

3	3	  O’er hills, dales, and rocks,

3	

3	3	  Away be it whirl’d

3	

3	3	  Till the silvery locks

3	

3	3	  Are all comb’d and curl’d!

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then there came a wind, so strong that it blew off Curdken’s hat; and

3	

3	3	away it flew over the hills: and he was forced to turn and run after

3	

3	3	it; till, by the time he came back, she had done combing and curling her

3	

3	3	hair, and had put it up again safe. Then he was very angry and sulky,

3	

3	3	and would not speak to her at all; but they watched the geese until it

3	

3	3	grew dark in the evening, and then drove them homewards.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The next morning, as they were going through the dark gate, the poor

3	

3	3	girl looked up at Falada’s head, and cried:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	and the head answered:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!

3	

3	3	  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,

3	

3	3	  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then she drove on the geese, and sat down again in the meadow, and began

3	

3	3	to comb out her hair as before; and Curdken ran up to her, and wanted to

3	

3	3	take hold of it; but she cried out quickly:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Blow, breezes, blow!

3	

3	3	  Let Curdken’s hat go!

3	

3	3	  Blow, breezes, blow!

3	

3	3	  Let him after it go!

3	

3	3	  O’er hills, dales, and rocks,

3	

3	3	  Away be it whirl’d

3	

3	3	  Till the silvery locks

3	

3	3	  Are all comb’d and curl’d!

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the wind came and blew away his hat; and off it flew a great way,

3	

3	3	over the hills and far away, so that he had to run after it; and when

3	

3	3	he came back she had bound up her hair again, and all was safe. So they

3	

3	3	watched the geese till it grew dark.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	In the evening, after they came home, Curdken went to the old king, and

3	

3	3	said, ‘I cannot have that strange girl to help me to keep the geese any

3	

3	3	longer.’ ‘Why?’ said the king. ‘Because, instead of doing any good, she

3	

3	3	does nothing but tease me all day long.’ Then the king made him tell him

3	

3	3	what had happened. And Curdken said, ‘When we go in the morning through

3	

3	3	the dark gate with our flock of geese, she cries and talks with the head

3	

3	3	of a horse that hangs upon the wall, and says:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	and the head answers:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!

3	

3	3	  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,

3	

3	3	  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon the meadow

3	

3	3	where the geese fed; how his hat was blown away; and how he was forced

3	

3	3	to run after it, and to leave his flock of geese to themselves. But the

3	

3	3	old king told the boy to go out again the next day: and when morning

3	

3	3	came, he placed himself behind the dark gate, and heard how she spoke

3	

3	3	to Falada, and how Falada answered. Then he went into the field, and

3	

3	3	hid himself in a bush by the meadow’s side; and he soon saw with his own

3	

3	3	eyes how they drove the flock of geese; and how, after a little time,

3	

3	3	she let down her hair that glittered in the sun. And then he heard her

3	

3	3	say:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Blow, breezes, blow!

3	

3	3	  Let Curdken’s hat go!

3	

3	3	  Blow, breezes, blow!

3	

3	3	  Let him after it go!

3	

3	3	  O’er hills, dales, and rocks,

3	

3	3	  Away be it whirl’d

3	

3	3	  Till the silvery locks

3	

3	3	  Are all comb’d and curl’d!

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And soon came a gale of wind, and carried away Curdken’s hat, and away

3	

3	3	went Curdken after it, while the girl went on combing and curling her

3	

3	3	hair. All this the old king saw: so he went home without being seen; and

3	

3	3	when the little goose-girl came back in the evening he called her aside,

3	

3	3	and asked her why she did so: but she burst into tears, and said, ‘That

3	

3	3	I must not tell you or any man, or I shall lose my life.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But the old king begged so hard, that she had no peace till she had told

3	

3	3	him all the tale, from beginning to end, word for word. And it was very

3	

3	3	lucky for her that she did so, for when she had done the king ordered

3	

3	3	royal clothes to be put upon her, and gazed on her with wonder, she was

3	

3	3	so beautiful. Then he called his son and told him that he had only a

3	

3	3	false bride; for that she was merely a waiting-maid, while the true

3	

3	3	bride stood by. And the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty, and

3	

3	3	heard how meek and patient she had been; and without saying anything to

3	

3	3	the false bride, the king ordered a great feast to be got ready for all

3	

3	3	his court. The bridegroom sat at the top, with the false princess on one

3	

3	3	side, and the true one on the other; but nobody knew her again, for her

3	

3	3	beauty was quite dazzling to their eyes; and she did not seem at all

3	

3	3	like the little goose-girl, now that she had her brilliant dress on.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When they had eaten and drank, and were very merry, the old king said

3	

3	3	he would tell them a tale. So he began, and told all the story of the

3	

3	3	princess, as if it was one that he had once heard; and he asked the

3	

3	3	true waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who would

3	

3	3	behave thus. ‘Nothing better,’ said this false bride, ‘than that she

3	

3	3	should be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and that

3	

3	3	two white horses should be put to it, and should drag it from street to

3	

3	3	street till she was dead.’ ‘Thou art she!’ said the old king; ‘and as

3	

3	3	thou has judged thyself, so shall it be done to thee.’ And the young

3	

3	3	king was then married to his true wife, and they reigned over the

3	

3	3	kingdom in peace and happiness all their lives; and the good fairy came

3	

3	3	to see them, and restored the faithful Falada to life again.

3

3	

3	3	THE ADVENTURES OF CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	1. HOW THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS TO EAT NUTS

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘The nuts are quite ripe now,’ said Chanticleer to his wife Partlet,

3	

3	3	‘suppose we go together to the mountains, and eat as many as we can,

3	

3	3	before the squirrel takes them all away.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said

3	

3	3	Partlet, ‘let us go and make a holiday of it together.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	So they went to the mountains; and as it was a lovely day, they stayed

3	

3	3	there till the evening. Now, whether it was that they had eaten so many

3	

3	3	nuts that they could not walk, or whether they were lazy and would not,

3	

3	3	I do not know: however, they took it into their heads that it did not

3	

3	3	become them to go home on foot. So Chanticleer began to build a little

3	

3	3	carriage of nutshells: and when it was finished, Partlet jumped into

3	

3	3	it and sat down, and bid Chanticleer harness himself to it and draw her

3	

3	3	home. ‘That’s a good joke!’ said Chanticleer; ‘no, that will never do;

3	

3	3	I had rather by half walk home; I’ll sit on the box and be coachman,

3	

3	3	if you like, but I’ll not draw.’ While this was passing, a duck came

3	

3	3	quacking up and cried out, ‘You thieving vagabonds, what business have

3	

3	3	you in my grounds? I’ll give it you well for your insolence!’ and upon

3	

3	3	that she fell upon Chanticleer most lustily. But Chanticleer was no

3	

3	3	coward, and returned the duck’s blows with his sharp spurs so fiercely

3	

3	3	that she soon began to cry out for mercy; which was only granted her

3	

3	3	upon condition that she would draw the carriage home for them. This she

3	

3	3	agreed to do; and Chanticleer got upon the box, and drove, crying, ‘Now,

3	

3	3	duck, get on as fast as you can.’ And away they went at a pretty good

3	

3	3	pace.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	After they had travelled along a little way, they met a needle and a pin

3	

3	3	walking together along the road: and the needle cried out, ‘Stop, stop!’

3	

3	3	and said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way, and such

3	

3	3	dirty walking they could not get on at all: he told them that he and his

3	

3	3	friend, the pin, had been at a public-house a few miles off, and had sat

3	

3	3	drinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he begged therefore

3	

3	3	that the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in their

3	

3	3	carriage. Chanticleer observing that they were but thin fellows, and not

3	

3	3	likely to take up much room, told them they might ride, but made them

3	

3	3	promise not to dirty the wheels of the carriage in getting in, nor to

3	

3	3	tread on Partlet’s toes.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Late at night they arrived at an inn; and as it was bad travelling in

3	

3	3	the dark, and the duck seemed much tired, and waddled about a good

3	

3	3	deal from one side to the other, they made up their minds to fix their

3	

3	3	quarters there: but the landlord at first was unwilling, and said his

3	

3	3	house was full, thinking they might not be very respectable company:

3	

3	3	however, they spoke civilly to him, and gave him the egg which Partlet

3	

3	3	had laid by the way, and said they would give him the duck, who was in

3	

3	3	the habit of laying one every day: so at last he let them come in, and

3	

3	3	they bespoke a handsome supper, and spent the evening very jollily.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Early in the morning, before it was quite light, and when nobody was

3	

3	3	stirring in the inn, Chanticleer awakened his wife, and, fetching the

3	

3	3	egg, they pecked a hole in it, ate it up, and threw the shells into the

3	

3	3	fireplace: they then went to the pin and needle, who were fast asleep,

3	

3	3	and seizing them by the heads, stuck one into the landlord’s easy chair

3	

3	3	and the other into his handkerchief; and, having done this, they crept

3	

3	3	away as softly as possible. However, the duck, who slept in the open

3	

3	3	air in the yard, heard them coming, and jumping into the brook which ran

3	

3	3	close by the inn, soon swam out of their reach.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	An hour or two afterwards the landlord got up, and took his handkerchief

3	

3	3	to wipe his face, but the pin ran into him and pricked him: then he

3	

3	3	walked into the kitchen to light his pipe at the fire, but when he

3	

3	3	stirred it up the eggshells flew into his eyes, and almost blinded him.

3	

3	3	‘Bless me!’ said he, ‘all the world seems to have a design against my

3	

3	3	head this morning’: and so saying, he threw himself sulkily into his

3	

3	3	easy chair; but, oh dear! the needle ran into him; and this time the

3	

3	3	pain was not in his head. He now flew into a very great passion, and,

3	

3	3	suspecting the company who had come in the night before, he went to look

3	

3	3	after them, but they were all off; so he swore that he never again

3	

3	3	would take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no

3	

3	3	reckoning, and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	2. HOW CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET WENT TO VISIT MR KORBES

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Another day, Chanticleer and Partlet wished to ride out together;

3	

3	3	so Chanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels, and

3	

3	3	harnessed six mice to it; and then he and Partlet got into the carriage,

3	

3	3	and away they drove. Soon afterwards a cat met them, and said, ‘Where

3	

3	3	are you going?’ And Chanticleer replied,

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘All on our way

3	

3	3	  A visit to pay

3	

3	3	  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the cat said, ‘Take me with you,’ Chanticleer said, ‘With all my

3	

3	3	heart: get up behind, and be sure you do not fall off.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Take care of this handsome coach of mine,

3	

3	3	  Nor dirty my pretty red wheels so fine!

3	

3	3	  Now, mice, be ready,

3	

3	3	  And, wheels, run steady!

3	

3	3	  For we are going a visit to pay

3	

3	3	  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Soon after came up a millstone, an egg, a duck, and a pin; and

3	

3	3	Chanticleer gave them all leave to get into the carriage and go with

3	

3	3	them.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When they arrived at Mr Korbes’s house, he was not at home; so the mice

3	

3	3	drew the carriage into the coach-house, Chanticleer and Partlet flew

3	

3	3	upon a beam, the cat sat down in the fireplace, the duck got into

3	

3	3	the washing cistern, the pin stuck himself into the bed pillow, the

3	

3	3	millstone laid himself over the house door, and the egg rolled himself

3	

3	3	up in the towel.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When Mr Korbes came home, he went to the fireplace to make a fire; but

3	

3	3	the cat threw all the ashes in his eyes: so he ran to the kitchen to

3	

3	3	wash himself; but there the duck splashed all the water in his face; and

3	

3	3	when he tried to wipe himself, the egg broke to pieces in the towel all

3	

3	3	over his face and eyes. Then he was very angry, and went without his

3	

3	3	supper to bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow, the pin ran into

3	

3	3	his cheek: at this he became quite furious, and, jumping up, would have

3	

3	3	run out of the house; but when he came to the door, the millstone fell

3	

3	3	down on his head, and killed him on the spot.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	3. HOW PARTLET DIED AND WAS BURIED, AND HOW CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEF

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Another day Chanticleer and Partlet agreed to go again to the mountains

3	

3	3	to eat nuts; and it was settled that all the nuts which they found

3	

3	3	should be shared equally between them. Now Partlet found a very large

3	

3	3	nut; but she said nothing about it to Chanticleer, and kept it all to

3	

3	3	herself: however, it was so big that she could not swallow it, and it

3	

3	3	stuck in her throat. Then she was in a great fright, and cried out to

3	

3	3	Chanticleer, ‘Pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or I

3	

3	3	shall be choked.’ Chanticleer ran as fast as he could to the river, and

3	

3	3	said, ‘River, give me some water, for Partlet lies in the mountain, and

3	

3	3	will be choked by a great nut.’ The river said, ‘Run first to the bride,

3	

3	3	and ask her for a silken cord to draw up the water.’ Chanticleer ran to

3	

3	3	the bride, and said, ‘Bride, you must give me a silken cord, for then

3	

3	3	the river will give me water, and the water I will carry to Partlet, who

3	

3	3	lies on the mountain, and will be choked by a great nut.’ But the bride

3	

3	3	said, ‘Run first, and bring me my garland that is hanging on a willow

3	

3	3	in the garden.’ Then Chanticleer ran to the garden, and took the garland

3	

3	3	from the bough where it hung, and brought it to the bride; and then

3	

3	3	the bride gave him the silken cord, and he took the silken cord to

3	

3	3	the river, and the river gave him water, and he carried the water to

3	

3	3	Partlet; but in the meantime she was choked by the great nut, and lay

3	

3	3	quite dead, and never moved any more.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then Chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the beasts

3	

3	3	came and wept with him over poor Partlet. And six mice built a little

3	

3	3	hearse to carry her to her grave; and when it was ready they harnessed

3	

3	3	themselves before it, and Chanticleer drove them. On the way they

3	

3	3	met the fox. ‘Where are you going, Chanticleer?’ said he. ‘To bury my

3	

3	3	Partlet,’ said the other. ‘May I go with you?’ said the fox. ‘Yes; but

3	

3	3	you must get up behind, or my horses will not be able to draw you.’ Then

3	

3	3	the fox got up behind; and presently the wolf, the bear, the goat, and

3	

3	3	all the beasts of the wood, came and climbed upon the hearse.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	So on they went till they came to a rapid stream. ‘How shall we get

3	

3	3	over?’ said Chanticleer. Then said a straw, ‘I will lay myself across,

3	

3	3	and you may pass over upon me.’ But as the mice were going over, the

3	

3	3	straw slipped away and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell in

3	

3	3	and were drowned. What was to be done? Then a large log of wood came

3	

3	3	and said, ‘I am big enough; I will lay myself across the stream, and you

3	

3	3	shall pass over upon me.’ So he laid himself down; but they managed

3	

3	3	so clumsily, that the log of wood fell in and was carried away by the

3	

3	3	stream. Then a stone, who saw what had happened, came up and kindly

3	

3	3	offered to help poor Chanticleer by laying himself across the stream;

3	

3	3	and this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse, and

3	

3	3	managed to get Partlet out of it; but the fox and the other mourners,

3	

3	3	who were sitting behind, were too heavy, and fell back into the water

3	

3	3	and were all carried away by the stream and drowned.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Thus Chanticleer was left alone with his dead Partlet; and having dug

3	

3	3	a grave for her, he laid her in it, and made a little hillock over her.

3	

3	3	Then he sat down by the grave, and wept and mourned, till at last he

3	

3	3	died too; and so all were dead.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	RAPUNZEL

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a

3	

3	3	child. At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire.

3	

3	3	These people had a little window at the back of their house from which

3	

3	3	a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful

3	

3	3	flowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no

3	

3	3	one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had

3	

3	3	great power and was dreaded by all the world. One day the woman was

3	

3	3	standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a

3	

3	3	bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it

3	

3	3	looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away,

3	

3	3	and began to look pale and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed, and

3	

3	3	asked: ‘What ails you, dear wife?’ ‘Ah,’ she replied, ‘if I can’t eat

3	

3	3	some of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall

3	

3	3	die.’ The man, who loved her, thought: ‘Sooner than let your wife die,

3	

3	3	bring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.’

3	

3	3	At twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the

3	

3	3	enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his

3	

3	3	wife. She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily. It

3	

3	3	tasted so good to her--so very good, that the next day she longed for it

3	

3	3	three times as much as before. If he was to have any rest, her husband

3	

3	3	must once more descend into the garden. In the gloom of evening

3	

3	3	therefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the

3	

3	3	wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before

3	

3	3	him. ‘How can you dare,’ said she with angry look, ‘descend into my

3	

3	3	garden and steal my rampion like a thief? You shall suffer for it!’

3	

3	3	‘Ah,’ answered he, ‘let mercy take the place of justice, I only made

3	

3	3	up my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the

3	

3	3	window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she

3	

3	3	had not got some to eat.’ Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be

3	

3	3	softened, and said to him: ‘If the case be as you say, I will allow

3	

3	3	you to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one

3	

3	3	condition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into

3	

3	3	the world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a

3	

3	3	mother.’ The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the

3	

3	3	woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the

3	

3	3	child the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was

3	

3	3	twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in

3	

3	3	a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a

3	

3	3	little window. When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself

3	

3	3	beneath it and cried:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,

3	

3	3	  Let down your hair to me.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she

3	

3	3	heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses,

3	

3	3	wound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair

3	

3	3	fell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	After a year or two, it came to pass that the king’s son rode through

3	

3	3	the forest and passed by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so

3	

3	3	charming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her

3	

3	3	solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The king’s

3	

3	3	son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower,

3	

3	3	but none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so deeply

3	

3	3	touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and

3	

3	3	listened to it. Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw

3	

3	3	that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,

3	

3	3	  Let down your hair to me.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress

3	

3	3	climbed up to her. ‘If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too

3	

3	3	will try my fortune,’ said he, and the next day when it began to grow

3	

3	3	dark, he went to the tower and cried:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,

3	

3	3	  Let down your hair to me.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Immediately the hair fell down and the king’s son climbed up.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes

3	

3	3	had never yet beheld, came to her; but the king’s son began to talk to

3	

3	3	her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred

3	

3	3	that it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her.

3	

3	3	Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take

3	

3	3	him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she

3	

3	3	thought: ‘He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does’; and she said

3	

3	3	yes, and laid her hand in his. She said: ‘I will willingly go away with

3	

3	3	you, but I do not know how to get down. Bring with you a skein of silk

3	

3	3	every time that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when

3	

3	3	that is ready I will descend, and you will take me on your horse.’ They

3	

3	3	agreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the

3	

3	3	old woman came by day. The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until

3	

3	3	once Rapunzel said to her: ‘Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that

3	

3	3	you are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young king’s son--he

3	

3	3	is with me in a moment.’ ‘Ah! you wicked child,’ cried the enchantress.

3	

3	3	‘What do I hear you say! I thought I had separated you from all

3	

3	3	the world, and yet you have deceived me!’ In her anger she clutched

3	

3	3	Rapunzel’s beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand,

3	

3	3	seized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut

3	

3	3	off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground. And she was so pitiless

3	

3	3	that she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great

3	

3	3	grief and misery.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	On the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however, the enchantress

3	

3	3	fastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the

3	

3	3	window, and when the king’s son came and cried:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,

3	

3	3	  Let down your hair to me.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	she let the hair down. The king’s son ascended, but instead of finding

3	

3	3	his dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with

3	

3	3	wicked and venomous looks. ‘Aha!’ she cried mockingly, ‘you would fetch

3	

3	3	your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest;

3	

3	3	the cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel is

3	

3	3	lost to you; you will never see her again.’ The king’s son was beside

3	

3	3	himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower. He

3	

3	3	escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell pierced his

3	

3	3	eyes. Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but

3	

3	3	roots and berries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of

3	

3	3	his dearest wife. Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at

3	

3	3	length came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she

3	

3	3	had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness. He heard a

3	

3	3	voice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and

3	

3	3	when he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept. Two

3	

3	3	of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could

3	

3	3	see with them as before. He led her to his kingdom where he was

3	

3	3	joyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and

3	

3	3	contented.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	FUNDEVOGEL

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt, and as

3	

3	3	he entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were

3	

3	3	there. He followed the sound, and at last came to a high tree, and at

3	

3	3	the top of this a little child was sitting, for the mother had fallen

3	

3	3	asleep under the tree with the child, and a bird of prey had seen it in

3	

3	3	her arms, had flown down, snatched it away, and set it on the high tree.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The forester climbed up, brought the child down, and thought to himself:

3	

3	3	‘You will take him home with you, and bring him up with your Lina.’ He

3	

3	3	took it home, therefore, and the two children grew up together. And the

3	

3	3	one, which he had found on a tree was called Fundevogel, because a bird

3	

3	3	had carried it away. Fundevogel and Lina loved each other so dearly that

3	

3	3	when they did not see each other they were sad.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Now the forester had an old cook, who one evening took two pails and

3	

3	3	began to fetch water, and did not go once only, but many times, out

3	

3	3	to the spring. Lina saw this and said, ‘Listen, old Sanna, why are you

3	

3	3	fetching so much water?’ ‘If you will never repeat it to anyone, I will

3	

3	3	tell you why.’ So Lina said, no, she would never repeat it to anyone,

3	

3	3	and then the cook said: ‘Early tomorrow morning, when the forester

3	

3	3	is out hunting, I will heat the water, and when it is boiling in the

3	

3	3	kettle, I will throw in Fundevogel, and will boil him in it.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Early next morning the forester got up and went out hunting, and when he

3	

3	3	was gone the children were still in bed. Then Lina said to Fundevogel:

3	

3	3	‘If you will never leave me, I too will never leave you.’ Fundevogel

3	

3	3	said: ‘Neither now, nor ever will I leave you.’ Then said Lina: ‘Then

3	

3	3	will I tell you. Last night, old Sanna carried so many buckets of water

3	

3	3	into the house that I asked her why she was doing that, and she said

3	

3	3	that if I would promise not to tell anyone, and she said that early

3	

3	3	tomorrow morning when father was out hunting, she would set the kettle

3	

3	3	full of water, throw you into it and boil you; but we will get up

3	

3	3	quickly, dress ourselves, and go away together.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The two children therefore got up, dressed themselves quickly, and went

3	

3	3	away. When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook went into the

3	

3	3	bedroom to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it. But when she came in,

3	

3	3	and went to the beds, both the children were gone. Then she was terribly

3	

3	3	alarmed, and she said to herself: ‘What shall I say now when the

3	

3	3	forester comes home and sees that the children are gone? They must be

3	

3	3	followed instantly to get them back again.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the cook sent three servants after them, who were to run and

3	

3	3	overtake the children. The children, however, were sitting outside the

3	

3	3	forest, and when they saw from afar the three servants running, Lina

3	

3	3	said to Fundevogel: ‘Never leave me, and I will never leave you.’

3	

3	3	Fundevogel said: ‘Neither now, nor ever.’ Then said Lina: ‘Do you become

3	

3	3	a rose-tree, and I the rose upon it.’ When the three servants came to

3	

3	3	the forest, nothing was there but a rose-tree and one rose on it, but

3	

3	3	the children were nowhere. Then said they: ‘There is nothing to be done

3	

3	3	here,’ and they went home and told the cook that they had seen nothing

3	

3	3	in the forest but a little rose-bush with one rose on it. Then the

3	

3	3	old cook scolded and said: ‘You simpletons, you should have cut the

3	

3	3	rose-bush in two, and have broken off the rose and brought it home with

3	

3	3	you; go, and do it at once.’ They had therefore to go out and look for

3	

3	3	the second time. The children, however, saw them coming from a distance.

3	

3	3	Then Lina said: ‘Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will never leave

3	

3	3	you.’ Fundevogel said: ‘Neither now; nor ever.’ Said Lina: ‘Then do you

3	

3	3	become a church, and I’ll be the chandelier in it.’ So when the three

3	

3	3	servants came, nothing was there but a church, with a chandelier in

3	

3	3	it. They said therefore to each other: ‘What can we do here, let us go

3	

3	3	home.’ When they got home, the cook asked if they had not found them;

3	

3	3	so they said no, they had found nothing but a church, and there was a

3	

3	3	chandelier in it. And the cook scolded them and said: ‘You fools! why

3	

3	3	did you not pull the church to pieces, and bring the chandelier home

3	

3	3	with you?’ And now the old cook herself got on her legs, and went with

3	

3	3	the three servants in pursuit of the children. The children, however,

3	

3	3	saw from afar that the three servants were coming, and the cook waddling

3	

3	3	after them. Then said Lina: ‘Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will

3	

3	3	never leave you.’ Then said Fundevogel: ‘Neither now, nor ever.’

3	

3	3	Said Lina: ‘Be a fishpond, and I will be the duck upon it.’ The cook,

3	

3	3	however, came up to them, and when she saw the pond she lay down by it,

3	

3	3	and was about to drink it up. But the duck swam quickly to her, seized

3	

3	3	her head in its beak and drew her into the water, and there the old

3	

3	3	witch had to drown. Then the children went home together, and were

3	

3	3	heartily delighted, and if they have not died, they are living still.

3	

3	3	THE VALIANT LITTLE TAILOR

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	One summer’s morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the

3	

3	3	window; he was in good spirits, and sewed with all his might. Then came

3	

3	3	a peasant woman down the street crying: ‘Good jams, cheap! Good jams,

3	

3	3	cheap!’ This rang pleasantly in the tailor’s ears; he stretched his

3	

3	3	delicate head out of the window, and called: ‘Come up here, dear woman;

3	

3	3	here you will get rid of your goods.’ The woman came up the three steps

3	

3	3	to the tailor with her heavy basket, and he made her unpack all the pots

3	

3	3	for him. He inspected each one, lifted it up, put his nose to it, and

3	

3	3	at length said: ‘The jam seems to me to be good, so weigh me out four

3	

3	3	ounces, dear woman, and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of no

3	

3	3	consequence.’ The woman who had hoped to find a good sale, gave him

3	

3	3	what he desired, but went away quite angry and grumbling. ‘Now, this jam

3	

3	3	shall be blessed by God,’ cried the little tailor, ‘and give me health

3	

3	3	and strength’; so he brought the bread out of the cupboard, cut himself

3	

3	3	a piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it. ‘This won’t

3	

3	3	taste bitter,’ said he, ‘but I will just finish the jacket before I

3	

3	3	take a bite.’ He laid the bread near him, sewed on, and in his joy, made

3	

3	3	bigger and bigger stitches. In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam

3	

3	3	rose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers, and they were

3	

3	3	attracted and descended on it in hosts. ‘Hi! who invited you?’ said the

3	

3	3	little tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away. The flies, however,

3	

3	3	who understood no German, would not be turned away, but came back

3	

3	3	again in ever-increasing companies. The little tailor at last lost all

3	

3	3	patience, and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work-table,

3	

3	3	and saying: ‘Wait, and I will give it to you,’ struck it mercilessly on

3	

3	3	them. When he drew it away and counted, there lay before him no fewer

3	

3	3	than seven, dead and with legs stretched out. ‘Are you a fellow of that

3	

3	3	sort?’ said he, and could not help admiring his own bravery. ‘The whole

3	

3	3	town shall know of this!’ And the little tailor hastened to cut himself

3	

3	3	a girdle, stitched it, and embroidered on it in large letters: ‘Seven at

3	

3	3	one stroke!’ ‘What, the town!’ he continued, ‘the whole world shall hear

3	

3	3	of it!’ and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb’s tail. The tailor

3	

3	3	put on the girdle, and resolved to go forth into the world, because he

3	

3	3	thought his workshop was too small for his valour. Before he went away,

3	

3	3	he sought about in the house to see if there was anything which he could

3	

3	3	take with him; however, he found nothing but an old cheese, and that

3	

3	3	he put in his pocket. In front of the door he observed a bird which

3	

3	3	had caught itself in the thicket. It had to go into his pocket with the

3	

3	3	cheese. Now he took to the road boldly, and as he was light and nimble,

3	

3	3	he felt no fatigue. The road led him up a mountain, and when he had

3	

3	3	reached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant looking

3	

3	3	peacefully about him. The little tailor went bravely up, spoke to him,

3	

3	3	and said: ‘Good day, comrade, so you are sitting there overlooking the

3	

3	3	wide-spread world! I am just on my way thither, and want to try my luck.

3	

3	3	Have you any inclination to go with me?’ The giant looked contemptuously

3	

3	3	at the tailor, and said: ‘You ragamuffin! You miserable creature!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Oh, indeed?’ answered the little tailor, and unbuttoned his coat, and

3	

3	3	showed the giant the girdle, ‘there may you read what kind of a man I

3	

3	3	am!’ The giant read: ‘Seven at one stroke,’ and thought that they had

3	

3	3	been men whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little respect

3	

3	3	for the tiny fellow. Nevertheless, he wished to try him first, and took

3	

3	3	a stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out

3	

3	3	of it. ‘Do that likewise,’ said the giant, ‘if you have strength.’ ‘Is

3	

3	3	that all?’ said the tailor, ‘that is child’s play with us!’ and put his

3	

3	3	hand into his pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until

3	

3	3	the liquid ran out of it. ‘Faith,’ said he, ‘that was a little better,

3	

3	3	wasn’t it?’ The giant did not know what to say, and could not believe it

3	

3	3	of the little man. Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high

3	

3	3	that the eye could scarcely follow it. ‘Now, little mite of a man, do

3	

3	3	that likewise,’ ‘Well thrown,’ said the tailor, ‘but after all the stone

3	

3	3	came down to earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come

3	

3	3	back at all,’ and he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird,

3	

3	3	and threw it into the air. The bird, delighted with its liberty,

3	

3	3	rose, flew away and did not come back. ‘How does that shot please you,

3	

3	3	comrade?’ asked the tailor. ‘You can certainly throw,’ said the giant,

3	

3	3	‘but now we will see if you are able to carry anything properly.’ He

3	

3	3	took the little tailor to a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on

3	

3	3	the ground, and said: ‘If you are strong enough, help me to carry the

3	

3	3	tree out of the forest.’ ‘Readily,’ answered the little man; ‘take you

3	

3	3	the trunk on your shoulders, and I will raise up the branches and twigs;

3	

3	3	after all, they are the heaviest.’ The giant took the trunk on his

3	

3	3	shoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who

3	

3	3	could not look round, had to carry away the whole tree, and the little

3	

3	3	tailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and

3	

3	3	whistled the song: ‘Three tailors rode forth from the gate,’ as if

3	

3	3	carrying the tree were child’s play. The giant, after he had dragged the

3	

3	3	heavy burden part of the way, could go no further, and cried: ‘Hark

3	

3	3	you, I shall have to let the tree fall!’ The tailor sprang nimbly down,

3	

3	3	seized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it, and said

3	

3	3	to the giant: ‘You are such a great fellow, and yet cannot even carry

3	

3	3	the tree!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	They went on together, and as they passed a cherry-tree, the giant laid

3	

3	3	hold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging, bent it

3	

3	3	down, gave it into the tailor’s hand, and bade him eat. But the little

3	

3	3	tailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant let it go,

3	

3	3	it sprang back again, and the tailor was tossed into the air with it.

3	

3	3	When he had fallen down again without injury, the giant said: ‘What is

3	

3	3	this? Have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig?’ ‘There is no

3	

3	3	lack of strength,’ answered the little tailor. ‘Do you think that could

3	

3	3	be anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow? I leapt over

3	

3	3	the tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket.

3	

3	3	Jump as I did, if you can do it.’ The giant made the attempt but he

3	

3	3	could not get over the tree, and remained hanging in the branches, so

3	

3	3	that in this also the tailor kept the upper hand.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The giant said: ‘If you are such a valiant fellow, come with me into our

3	

3	3	cavern and spend the night with us.’ The little tailor was willing, and

3	

3	3	followed him. When they went into the cave, other giants were sitting

3	

3	3	there by the fire, and each of them had a roasted sheep in his hand and

3	

3	3	was eating it. The little tailor looked round and thought: ‘It is much

3	

3	3	more spacious here than in my workshop.’ The giant showed him a bed, and

3	

3	3	said he was to lie down in it and sleep. The bed, however, was too

3	

3	3	big for the little tailor; he did not lie down in it, but crept into

3	

3	3	a corner. When it was midnight, and the giant thought that the little

3	

3	3	tailor was lying in a sound sleep, he got up, took a great iron bar,

3	

3	3	cut through the bed with one blow, and thought he had finished off the

3	

3	3	grasshopper for good. With the earliest dawn the giants went into the

3	

3	3	forest, and had quite forgotten the little tailor, when all at once he

3	

3	3	walked up to them quite merrily and boldly. The giants were terrified,

3	

3	3	they were afraid that he would strike them all dead, and ran away in a

3	

3	3	great hurry.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The little tailor went onwards, always following his own pointed nose.

3	

3	3	After he had walked for a long time, he came to the courtyard of a royal

3	

3	3	palace, and as he felt weary, he lay down on the grass and fell asleep.

3	

3	3	Whilst he lay there, the people came and inspected him on all sides, and

3	

3	3	read on his girdle: ‘Seven at one stroke.’ ‘Ah!’ said they, ‘what does

3	

3	3	the great warrior want here in the midst of peace? He must be a mighty

3	

3	3	lord.’ They went and announced him to the king, and gave it as their

3	

3	3	opinion that if war should break out, this would be a weighty and useful

3	

3	3	man who ought on no account to be allowed to depart. The counsel pleased

3	

3	3	the king, and he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offer

3	

3	3	him military service when he awoke. The ambassador remained standing by

3	

3	3	the sleeper, waited until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes,

3	

3	3	and then conveyed to him this proposal. ‘For this very reason have

3	

3	3	I come here,’ the tailor replied, ‘I am ready to enter the king’s

3	

3	3	service.’ He was therefore honourably received, and a special dwelling

3	

3	3	was assigned him.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The soldiers, however, were set against the little tailor, and wished

3	

3	3	him a thousand miles away. ‘What is to be the end of this?’ they said

3	

3	3	among themselves. ‘If we quarrel with him, and he strikes about him,

3	

3	3	seven of us will fall at every blow; not one of us can stand against

3	

3	3	him.’ They came therefore to a decision, betook themselves in a body to

3	

3	3	the king, and begged for their dismissal. ‘We are not prepared,’ said

3	

3	3	they, ‘to stay with a man who kills seven at one stroke.’ The king was

3	

3	3	sorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful servants,

3	

3	3	wished that he had never set eyes on the tailor, and would willingly

3	

3	3	have been rid of him again. But he did not venture to give him his

3	

3	3	dismissal, for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his people

3	

3	3	dead, and place himself on the royal throne. He thought about it for a

3	

3	3	long time, and at last found good counsel. He sent to the little tailor

3	

3	3	and caused him to be informed that as he was a great warrior, he had one

3	

3	3	request to make to him. In a forest of his country lived two giants,

3	

3	3	who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging,

3	

3	3	and burning, and no one could approach them without putting himself in

3	

3	3	danger of death. If the tailor conquered and killed these two giants, he

3	

3	3	would give him his only daughter to wife, and half of his kingdom as a

3	

3	3	dowry, likewise one hundred horsemen should go with him to assist him.

3	

3	3	‘That would indeed be a fine thing for a man like me!’ thought the

3	

3	3	little tailor. ‘One is not offered a beautiful princess and half a

3	

3	3	kingdom every day of one’s life!’ ‘Oh, yes,’ he replied, ‘I will soon

3	

3	3	subdue the giants, and do not require the help of the hundred horsemen

3	

3	3	to do it; he who can hit seven with one blow has no need to be afraid of

3	

3	3	two.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The little tailor went forth, and the hundred horsemen followed him.

3	

3	3	When he came to the outskirts of the forest, he said to his followers:

3	

3	3	‘Just stay waiting here, I alone will soon finish off the giants.’ Then

3	

3	3	he bounded into the forest and looked about right and left. After a

3	

3	3	while he perceived both giants. They lay sleeping under a tree, and

3	

3	3	snored so that the branches waved up and down. The little tailor, not

3	

3	3	idle, gathered two pocketsful of stones, and with these climbed up the

3	

3	3	tree. When he was halfway up, he slipped down by a branch, until he sat

3	

3	3	just above the sleepers, and then let one stone after another fall on

3	

3	3	the breast of one of the giants. For a long time the giant felt nothing,

3	

3	3	but at last he awoke, pushed his comrade, and said: ‘Why are you

3	

3	3	knocking me?’ ‘You must be dreaming,’ said the other, ‘I am not knocking

3	

3	3	you.’ They laid themselves down to sleep again, and then the tailor

3	

3	3	threw a stone down on the second. ‘What is the meaning of this?’ cried

3	

3	3	the other ‘Why are you pelting me?’ ‘I am not pelting you,’ answered

3	

3	3	the first, growling. They disputed about it for a time, but as they were

3	

3	3	weary they let the matter rest, and their eyes closed once more. The

3	

3	3	little tailor began his game again, picked out the biggest stone, and

3	

3	3	threw it with all his might on the breast of the first giant. ‘That

3	

3	3	is too bad!’ cried he, and sprang up like a madman, and pushed his

3	

3	3	companion against the tree until it shook. The other paid him back in

3	

3	3	the same coin, and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees and

3	

3	3	belaboured each other so long, that at last they both fell down dead on

3	

3	3	the ground at the same time. Then the little tailor leapt down. ‘It is

3	

3	3	a lucky thing,’ said he, ‘that they did not tear up the tree on which

3	

3	3	I was sitting, or I should have had to sprint on to another like a

3	

3	3	squirrel; but we tailors are nimble.’ He drew out his sword and gave

3	

3	3	each of them a couple of thrusts in the breast, and then went out to the

3	

3	3	horsemen and said: ‘The work is done; I have finished both of them

3	

3	3	off, but it was hard work! They tore up trees in their sore need, and

3	

3	3	defended themselves with them, but all that is to no purpose when a man

3	

3	3	like myself comes, who can kill seven at one blow.’ ‘But are you not

3	

3	3	wounded?’ asked the horsemen. ‘You need not concern yourself about

3	

3	3	that,’ answered the tailor, ‘they have not bent one hair of mine.’ The

3	

3	3	horsemen would not believe him, and rode into the forest; there they

3	

3	3	found the giants swimming in their blood, and all round about lay the

3	

3	3	torn-up trees.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward; he, however,

3	

3	3	repented of his promise, and again bethought himself how he could get

3	

3	3	rid of the hero. ‘Before you receive my daughter, and the half of my

3	

3	3	kingdom,’ said he to him, ‘you must perform one more heroic deed. In

3	

3	3	the forest roams a unicorn which does great harm, and you must catch

3	

3	3	it first.’ ‘I fear one unicorn still less than two giants. Seven at one

3	

3	3	blow, is my kind of affair.’ He took a rope and an axe with him, went

3	

3	3	forth into the forest, and again bade those who were sent with him to

3	

3	3	wait outside. He had not long to seek. The unicorn soon came towards

3	

3	3	him, and rushed directly on the tailor, as if it would gore him with its

3	

3	3	horn without more ado. ‘Softly, softly; it can’t be done as quickly as

3	

3	3	that,’ said he, and stood still and waited until the animal was quite

3	

3	3	close, and then sprang nimbly behind the tree. The unicorn ran against

3	

3	3	the tree with all its strength, and stuck its horn so fast in the trunk

3	

3	3	that it had not the strength enough to draw it out again, and thus it

3	

3	3	was caught. ‘Now, I have got the bird,’ said the tailor, and came out

3	

3	3	from behind the tree and put the rope round its neck, and then with his

3	

3	3	axe he hewed the horn out of the tree, and when all was ready he led the

3	

3	3	beast away and took it to the king.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The king still would not give him the promised reward, and made a third

3	

3	3	demand. Before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a wild boar that

3	

3	3	made great havoc in the forest, and the huntsmen should give him their

3	

3	3	help. ‘Willingly,’ said the tailor, ‘that is child’s play!’ He did not

3	

3	3	take the huntsmen with him into the forest, and they were well pleased

3	

3	3	that he did not, for the wild boar had several times received them in

3	

3	3	such a manner that they had no inclination to lie in wait for him. When

3	

3	3	the boar perceived the tailor, it ran on him with foaming mouth and

3	

3	3	whetted tusks, and was about to throw him to the ground, but the hero

3	

3	3	fled and sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window at

3	

3	3	once, and in one bound out again. The boar ran after him, but the tailor

3	

3	3	ran round outside and shut the door behind it, and then the raging

3	

3	3	beast, which was much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the window,

3	

3	3	was caught. The little tailor called the huntsmen thither that they

3	

3	3	might see the prisoner with their own eyes. The hero, however, went to

3	

3	3	the king, who was now, whether he liked it or not, obliged to keep his

3	

3	3	promise, and gave his daughter and the half of his kingdom. Had he known

3	

3	3	that it was no warlike hero, but a little tailor who was standing before

3	

3	3	him, it would have gone to his heart still more than it did. The wedding

3	

3	3	was held with great magnificence and small joy, and out of a tailor a

3	

3	3	king was made.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	After some time the young queen heard her husband say in his dreams at

3	

3	3	night: ‘Boy, make me the doublet, and patch the pantaloons, or else I

3	

3	3	will rap the yard-measure over your ears.’ Then she discovered in what

3	

3	3	state of life the young lord had been born, and next morning complained

3	

3	3	of her wrongs to her father, and begged him to help her to get rid of

3	

3	3	her husband, who was nothing else but a tailor. The king comforted her

3	

3	3	and said: ‘Leave your bedroom door open this night, and my servants

3	

3	3	shall stand outside, and when he has fallen asleep shall go in, bind

3	

3	3	him, and take him on board a ship which shall carry him into the wide

3	

3	3	world.’ The woman was satisfied with this; but the king’s armour-bearer,

3	

3	3	who had heard all, was friendly with the young lord, and informed him of

3	

3	3	the whole plot. ‘I’ll put a screw into that business,’ said the little

3	

3	3	tailor. At night he went to bed with his wife at the usual time, and

3	

3	3	when she thought that he had fallen asleep, she got up, opened the door,

3	

3	3	and then lay down again. The little tailor, who was only pretending to

3	

3	3	be asleep, began to cry out in a clear voice: ‘Boy, make me the doublet

3	

3	3	and patch me the pantaloons, or I will rap the yard-measure over your

3	

3	3	ears. I smote seven at one blow. I killed two giants, I brought away one

3	

3	3	unicorn, and caught a wild boar, and am I to fear those who are standing

3	

3	3	outside the room.’ When these men heard the tailor speaking thus, they

3	

3	3	were overcome by a great dread, and ran as if the wild huntsman were

3	

3	3	behind them, and none of them would venture anything further against

3	

3	3	him. So the little tailor was and remained a king to the end of his

3	

3	3	life.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	HANSEL AND GRETEL

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his

3	

3	3	two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had

3	

3	3	little to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the

3	

3	3	land, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought

3	

3	3	over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he

3	

3	3	groaned and said to his wife: ‘What is to become of us? How are we

3	

3	3	to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for

3	

3	3	ourselves?’ ‘I’ll tell you what, husband,’ answered the woman, ‘early

3	

3	3	tomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where

3	

3	3	it is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them, and give each

3	

3	3	of them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and

3	

3	3	leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be

3	

3	3	rid of them.’ ‘No, wife,’ said the man, ‘I will not do that; how can I

3	

3	3	bear to leave my children alone in the forest?--the wild animals would

3	

3	3	soon come and tear them to pieces.’ ‘O, you fool!’ said she, ‘then we

3	

3	3	must all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our

3	

3	3	coffins,’ and she left him no peace until he consented. ‘But I feel very

3	

3	3	sorry for the poor children, all the same,’ said the man.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had

3	

3	3	heard what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept

3	

3	3	bitter tears, and said to Hansel: ‘Now all is over with us.’ ‘Be quiet,

3	

3	3	Gretel,’ said Hansel, ‘do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way

3	

3	3	to help us.’ And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put

3	

3	3	on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon

3	

3	3	shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house

3	

3	3	glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the

3	

3	3	little pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he went

3	

3	3	back and said to Gretel: ‘Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in

3	

3	3	peace, God will not forsake us,’ and he lay down again in his bed. When

3	

3	3	day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the

3	

3	3	two children, saying: ‘Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the

3	

3	3	forest to fetch wood.’ She gave each a little piece of bread, and said:

3	

3	3	‘There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then,

3	

3	3	for you will get nothing else.’ Gretel took the bread under her apron,

3	

3	3	as Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out together

3	

3	3	on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel

3	

3	3	stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again.

3	

3	3	His father said: ‘Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying

3	

3	3	behind for? Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs.’ ‘Ah,

3	

3	3	father,’ said Hansel, ‘I am looking at my little white cat, which is

3	

3	3	sitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me.’ The wife said:

3	

3	3	‘Fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is

3	

3	3	shining on the chimneys.’ Hansel, however, had not been looking back at

3	

3	3	the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones

3	

3	3	out of his pocket on the road.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: ‘Now,

3	

3	3	children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not

3	

3	3	be cold.’ Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a

3	

3	3	little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning

3	

3	3	very high, the woman said: ‘Now, children, lay yourselves down by the

3	

3	3	fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we

3	

3	3	have done, we will come back and fetch you away.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little

3	

3	3	piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they

3	

3	3	believed that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but

3	

3	3	a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was

3	

3	3	blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long

3	

3	3	time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When

3	

3	3	at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and

3	

3	3	said: ‘How are we to get out of the forest now?’ But Hansel comforted

3	

3	3	her and said: ‘Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we

3	

3	3	will soon find the way.’ And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took

3	

3	3	his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like

3	

3	3	newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	They walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more

3	

3	3	to their father’s house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman

3	

3	3	opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: ‘You naughty

3	

3	3	children, why have you slept so long in the forest?--we thought you were

3	

3	3	never coming back at all!’ The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut

3	

3	3	him to the heart to leave them behind alone.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Not long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the

3	

3	3	land, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their

3	

3	3	father: ‘Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that

3	

3	3	is the end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the

3	

3	3	wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other

3	

3	3	means of saving ourselves!’ The man’s heart was heavy, and he thought:

3	

3	3	‘It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your

3	

3	3	children.’ The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to

3	

3	3	say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise,

3	

3	3	and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time

3	

3	3	also.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation.

3	

3	3	When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go

3	

3	3	out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked

3	

3	3	the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his

3	

3	3	little sister, and said: ‘Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the

3	

3	3	good God will help us.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Early in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their

3	

3	3	beds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller

3	

3	3	than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his

3	

3	3	in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground.

3	

3	3	‘Hansel, why do you stop and look round?’ said the father, ‘go on.’ ‘I

3	

3	3	am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and

3	

3	3	wants to say goodbye to me,’ answered Hansel. ‘Fool!’ said the woman,

3	

3	3	‘that is not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining

3	

3	3	on the chimney.’ Hansel, however little by little, threw all the crumbs

3	

3	3	on the path.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had

3	

3	3	never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and

3	

3	3	the mother said: ‘Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired

3	

3	3	you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in

3	

3	3	the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.’ When

3	

3	3	it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had

3	

3	3	scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but

3	

3	3	no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark

3	

3	3	night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said: ‘Just wait,

3	

3	3	Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread

3	

3	3	which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.’ When

3	

3	3	the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many

3	

3	3	thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked

3	

3	3	them all up. Hansel said to Gretel: ‘We shall soon find the way,’ but

3	

3	3	they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day

3	

3	3	too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest,

3	

3	3	and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three

3	

3	3	berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their

3	

3	3	legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell

3	

3	3	asleep.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	It was now three mornings since they had left their father’s house. They

3	

3	3	began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if

3	

3	3	help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it

3	

3	3	was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough,

3	

3	3	which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And

3	

3	3	when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them,

3	

3	3	and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of

3	

3	3	which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw

3	

3	3	that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows

3	

3	3	were of clear sugar. ‘We will set to work on that,’ said Hansel, ‘and

3	

3	3	have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat

3	

3	3	some of the window, it will taste sweet.’ Hansel reached up above, and

3	

3	3	broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant

3	

3	3	against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried

3	

3	3	from the parlour:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Nibble, nibble, gnaw,

3	

3	3	  Who is nibbling at my little house?’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The children answered:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘The wind, the wind,

3	

3	3	  The heaven-born wind,’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	and went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the

3	

3	3	taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out

3	

3	3	the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with

3	

3	3	it. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who

3	

3	3	supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were

3	

3	3	so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their

3	

3	3	hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said: ‘Oh, you dear

3	

3	3	children, who has brought you here? do come in, and stay with me. No

3	

3	3	harm shall happen to you.’ She took them both by the hand, and led them

3	

3	3	into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and

3	

3	3	pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little

3	

3	3	beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down

3	

3	3	in them, and thought they were in heaven.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality

3	

3	3	a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the

3	

3	3	little house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell

3	

3	3	into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast

3	

3	3	day with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have

3	

3	3	a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near.

3	

3	3	When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighbourhood, she laughed with

3	

3	3	malice, and said mockingly: ‘I have them, they shall not escape me

3	

3	3	again!’ Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was

3	

3	3	already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so

3	

3	3	pretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself: ‘That

3	

3	3	will be a dainty mouthful!’ Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled

3	

3	3	hand, carried him into a little stable, and locked him in behind a

3	

3	3	grated door. Scream as he might, it would not help him. Then she went to

3	

3	3	Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: ‘Get up, lazy thing, fetch

3	

3	3	some water, and cook something good for your brother, he is in the

3	

3	3	stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.’

3	

3	3	Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for she was

3	

3	3	forced to do what the wicked witch commanded.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing

3	

3	3	but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and

3	

3	3	cried: ‘Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon

3	

3	3	be fat.’ Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and

3	

3	3	the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was

3	

3	3	Hansel’s finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening

3	

3	3	him. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she

3	

3	3	was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. ‘Now, then,

3	

3	3	Gretel,’ she cried to the girl, ‘stir yourself, and bring some water.

3	

3	3	Let Hansel be fat or lean, tomorrow I will kill him, and cook him.’ Ah,

3	

3	3	how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water,

3	

3	3	and how her tears did flow down her cheeks! ‘Dear God, do help us,’ she

3	

3	3	cried. ‘If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should

3	

3	3	at any rate have died together.’ ‘Just keep your noise to yourself,’

3	

3	3	said the old woman, ‘it won’t help you at all.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Early in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with

3	

3	3	the water, and light the fire. ‘We will bake first,’ said the old woman,

3	

3	3	‘I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.’ She pushed poor

3	

3	3	Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting.

3	

3	3	‘Creep in,’ said the witch, ‘and see if it is properly heated, so that

3	

3	3	we can put the bread in.’ And once Gretel was inside, she intended to

3	

3	3	shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too.

3	

3	3	But Gretel saw what she had in mind, and said: ‘I do not know how I am

3	

3	3	to do it; how do I get in?’ ‘Silly goose,’ said the old woman. ‘The door

3	

3	3	is big enough; just look, I can get in myself!’ and she crept up and

3	

3	3	thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove

3	

3	3	her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then

3	

3	3	she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away and the godless

3	

3	3	witch was miserably burnt to death.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Gretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable,

3	

3	3	and cried: ‘Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!’ Then Hansel

3	

3	3	sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened. How they did

3	

3	3	rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And

3	

3	3	as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch’s

3	

3	3	house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels.

3	

3	3	‘These are far better than pebbles!’ said Hansel, and thrust into his

3	

3	3	pockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said: ‘I, too, will take

3	

3	3	something home with me,’ and filled her pinafore full. ‘But now we must

3	

3	3	be off,’ said Hansel, ‘that we may get out of the witch’s forest.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of

3	

3	3	water. ‘We cannot cross,’ said Hansel, ‘I see no foot-plank, and no

3	

3	3	bridge.’ ‘And there is also no ferry,’ answered Gretel, ‘but a white

3	

3	3	duck is swimming there: if I ask her, she will help us over.’ Then she

3	

3	3	cried:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,

3	

3	3	  Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?

3	

3	3	  There’s never a plank, or bridge in sight,

3	

3	3	  Take us across on thy back so white.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told

3	

3	3	his sister to sit by him. ‘No,’ replied Gretel, ‘that will be too heavy

3	

3	3	for the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.’ The

3	

3	3	good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had

3	

3	3	walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar

3	

3	3	to them, and at length they saw from afar their father’s house. Then

3	

3	3	they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round

3	

3	3	their father’s neck. The man had not known one happy hour since he had

3	

3	3	left the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel

3	

3	3	emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the

3	

3	3	room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to

3	

3	3	add to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together

3	

3	3	in perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse; whosoever

3	

3	3	catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	THE MOUSE, THE BIRD, AND THE SAUSAGE

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Once upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into

3	

3	3	partnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well;

3	

3	3	they lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add

3	

3	3	considerably to their stores. The bird’s duty was to fly daily into the

3	

3	3	wood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw

3	

3	3	to the cooking.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When people are too well off they always begin to long for something

3	

3	3	new. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a

3	

3	3	fellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his

3	

3	3	household arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a

3	

3	3	poor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed

3	

3	3	at home and had a good time of it. For, when the mouse had made the fire

3	

3	3	and fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest

3	

3	3	until it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to watch the

3	

3	3	pot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near

3	

3	3	dinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out

3	

3	3	among the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered,

3	

3	3	and salted, and ready to be served. Then, when the bird came home and

3	

3	3	had laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had

3	

3	3	finished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following

3	

3	3	morning: and that was really a very delightful life.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Influenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in

3	

3	3	the wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough,

3	

3	3	and had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a

3	

3	3	change, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and pray

3	

3	3	as the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained

3	

3	3	master of the situation, and the venture had to be made. They therefore

3	

3	3	drew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse

3	

3	3	to cook, and to the bird to fetch the water.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And now what happened? The sausage started in search of wood, the bird

3	

3	3	made the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited

3	

3	3	till the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the

3	

3	3	sausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird

3	

3	3	flew out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he came across

3	

3	3	a dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate

3	

3	3	booty, and so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained to the dog

3	

3	3	of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for

3	

3	3	the dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and

3	

3	3	that was the reason his life had been forfeited.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	He picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he

3	

3	3	had seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the

3	

3	3	best of things and to remain with one another.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	So now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and,

3	

3	3	wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and

3	

3	3	out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the

3	

3	3	pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having

3	

3	3	already parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Presently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he

3	

3	3	could nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood

3	

3	3	here and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to

3	

3	3	be found. Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down,

3	

3	3	caught fire and began to blaze. The bird hastened to fetch some water,

3	

3	3	but his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable

3	

3	3	to recover himself, he was drowned.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	MOTHER HOLLE

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Once upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters; one of them

3	

3	3	was beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy. The mother,

3	

3	3	however, loved the ugly and lazy one best, because she was her own

3	

3	3	daughter, and so the other, who was only her stepdaughter, was made

3	

3	3	to do all the work of the house, and was quite the Cinderella of the

3	

3	3	family. Her stepmother sent her out every day to sit by the well in

3	

3	3	the high road, there to spin until she made her fingers bleed. Now it

3	

3	3	chanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle, and as the girl

3	

3	3	stopped over the well to wash it off, the spindle suddenly sprang out

3	

3	3	of her hand and fell into the well. She ran home crying to tell of her

3	

3	3	misfortune, but her stepmother spoke harshly to her, and after giving

3	

3	3	her a violent scolding, said unkindly, ‘As you have let the spindle fall

3	

3	3	into the well you may go yourself and fetch it out.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The girl went back to the well not knowing what to do, and at last in

3	

3	3	her distress she jumped into the water after the spindle.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	She remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in a

3	

3	3	beautiful meadow, full of sunshine, and with countless flowers blooming

3	

3	3	in every direction.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	She walked over the meadow, and presently she came upon a baker’s oven

3	

3	3	full of bread, and the loaves cried out to her, ‘Take us out, take us

3	

3	3	out, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long

3	

3	3	ago.’ So she took the bread-shovel and drew them all out.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	She went on a little farther, till she came to a tree full of apples.

3	

3	3	‘Shake me, shake me, I pray,’ cried the tree; ‘my apples, one and all,

3	

3	3	are ripe.’ So she shook the tree, and the apples came falling down upon

3	

3	3	her like rain; but she continued shaking until there was not a single

3	

3	3	apple left upon it. Then she carefully gathered the apples together in a

3	

3	3	heap and walked on again.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an old

3	

3	3	woman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified, and

3	

3	3	turned to run away. But the old woman called after her, ‘What are you

3	

3	3	afraid of, dear child? Stay with me; if you will do the work of my house

3	

3	3	properly for me, I will make you very happy. You must be very careful,

3	

3	3	however, to make my bed in the right way, for I wish you always to shake

3	

3	3	it thoroughly, so that the feathers fly about; then they say, down there

3	

3	3	in the world, that it is snowing; for I am Mother Holle.’ The old woman

3	

3	3	spoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter

3	

3	3	into her service.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	She took care to do everything according to the old woman’s bidding and

3	

3	3	every time she made the bed she shook it with all her might, so that the

3	

3	3	feathers flew about like so many snowflakes. The old woman was as good

3	

3	3	as her word: she never spoke angrily to her, and gave her roast and

3	

3	3	boiled meats every day.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	So she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began

3	

3	3	to grow unhappy. She could not at first tell why she felt sad, but she

3	

3	3	became conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew she

3	

3	3	was homesick, although she was a thousand times better off with Mother

3	

3	3	Holle than with her mother and sister. After waiting awhile, she went

3	

3	3	to Mother Holle and said, ‘I am so homesick, that I cannot stay with

3	

3	3	you any longer, for although I am so happy here, I must return to my own

3	

3	3	people.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then Mother Holle said, ‘I am pleased that you should want to go back

3	

3	3	to your own people, and as you have served me so well and faithfully, I

3	

3	3	will take you home myself.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Thereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway. The gate

3	

3	3	was opened, and as the girl passed through, a shower of gold fell upon

3	

3	3	her, and the gold clung to her, so that she was covered with it from

3	

3	3	head to foot.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘That is a reward for your industry,’ said Mother Holle, and as she

3	

3	3	spoke she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The gate was then closed, and the girl found herself back in the old

3	

3	3	world close to her mother’s house. As she entered the courtyard, the

3	

3	3	cock who was perched on the well, called out:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Cock-a-doodle-doo!

3	

3	3	  Your golden daughter’s come back to you.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then she went in to her mother and sister, and as she was so richly

3	

3	3	covered with gold, they gave her a warm welcome. She related to them

3	

3	3	all that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by her

3	

3	3	great riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter to go

3	

3	3	and try her fortune. So she made the sister go and sit by the well

3	

3	3	and spin, and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into a

3	

3	3	thorn-bush, so that she might drop some blood on to the spindle; then

3	

3	3	she threw it into the well, and jumped in herself.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Like her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow, and walked over it

3	

3	3	till she came to the oven. ‘Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall

3	

3	3	be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago,’ cried the loaves

3	

3	3	as before. But the lazy girl answered, ‘Do you think I am going to dirty

3	

3	3	my hands for you?’ and walked on.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Presently she came to the apple-tree. ‘Shake me, shake me, I pray; my

3	

3	3	apples, one and all, are ripe,’ it cried. But she only answered, ‘A nice

3	

3	3	thing to ask me to do, one of the apples might fall on my head,’ and

3	

3	3	passed on.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	At last she came to Mother Holle’s house, and as she had heard all about

3	

3	3	the large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and engaged

3	

3	3	herself without delay to the old woman.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted herself

3	

3	3	to please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should get in

3	

3	3	return. The next day, however, she began to dawdle over her work, and

3	

3	3	the third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie in bed in

3	

3	3	the mornings and refused to get up. Worse still, she neglected to

3	

3	3	make the old woman’s bed properly, and forgot to shake it so that the

3	

3	3	feathers might fly about. So Mother Holle very soon got tired of her,

3	

3	3	and told her she might go. The lazy girl was delighted at this, and

3	

3	3	thought to herself, ‘The gold will soon be mine.’ Mother Holle led her,

3	

3	3	as she had led her sister, to the broad gateway; but as she was passing

3	

3	3	through, instead of the shower of gold, a great bucketful of pitch came

3	

3	3	pouring over her.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘That is in return for your services,’ said the old woman, and she shut

3	

3	3	the gate.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	So the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch, and the cock on the

3	

3	3	well called out as she saw her:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Cock-a-doodle-doo!

3	

3	3	  Your dirty daughter’s come back to you.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But, try what she would, she could not get the pitch off and it stuck to

3	

3	3	her as long as she lived.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	LITTLE RED-CAP [LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone

3	

3	3	who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was

3	

3	3	nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a

3	

3	3	little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never

3	

3	3	wear anything else; so she was always called ‘Little Red-Cap.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	One day her mother said to her: ‘Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece

3	

3	3	of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill

3	

3	3	and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and

3	

3	3	when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path,

3	

3	3	or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will

3	

3	3	get nothing; and when you go into her room, don’t forget to say, “Good

3	

3	3	morning”, and don’t peep into every corner before you do it.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘I will take great care,’ said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave

3	

3	3	her hand on it.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village,

3	

3	3	and just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red-Cap

3	

3	3	did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of

3	

3	3	him.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Good day, Little Red-Cap,’ said he.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Thank you kindly, wolf.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘To my grandmother’s.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘What have you got in your apron?’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to

3	

3	3	have something good, to make her stronger.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands

3	

3	3	under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you

3	

3	3	surely must know it,’ replied Little Red-Cap.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The wolf thought to himself: ‘What a tender young creature! what a nice

3	

3	3	plump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must

3	

3	3	act craftily, so as to catch both.’ So he walked for a short time by

3	

3	3	the side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said: ‘See, Little Red-Cap, how

3	

3	3	pretty the flowers are about here--why do you not look round? I believe,

3	

3	3	too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you

3	

3	3	walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else

3	

3	3	out here in the wood is merry.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Little Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing

3	

3	3	here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere,

3	

3	3	she thought: ‘Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would

3	

3	3	please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there

3	

3	3	in good time’; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for

3	

3	3	flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a

3	

3	3	still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and

3	

3	3	deeper into the wood.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother’s house and knocked

3	

3	3	at the door.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Who is there?’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Little Red-Cap,’ replied the wolf. ‘She is bringing cake and wine; open

3	

3	3	the door.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Lift the latch,’ called out the grandmother, ‘I am too weak, and cannot

3	

3	3	get up.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a

3	

3	3	word he went straight to the grandmother’s bed, and devoured her. Then

3	

3	3	he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed

3	

3	3	and drew the curtains.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Little Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers,

3	

3	3	and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she

3	

3	3	remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she

3	

3	3	went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to

3	

3	3	herself: ‘Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like

3	

3	3	being with grandmother so much.’ She called out: ‘Good morning,’ but

3	

3	3	received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.

3	

3	3	There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and

3	

3	3	looking very strange.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Oh! grandmother,’ she said, ‘what big ears you have!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘The better to hear you with, my child,’ was the reply.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!’ she said.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘The better to see you with, my dear.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘But, grandmother, what large hands you have!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘The better to hug you with.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘The better to eat you with!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of

3	

3	3	bed and swallowed up Red-Cap.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed,

3	

3	3	fell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing

3	

3	3	the house, and thought to himself: ‘How the old woman is snoring! I must

3	

3	3	just see if she wants anything.’ So he went into the room, and when he

3	

3	3	came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. ‘Do I find you

3	

3	3	here, you old sinner!’ said he. ‘I have long sought you!’ Then just as

3	

3	3	he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have

3	

3	3	devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did

3	

3	3	not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach

3	

3	3	of the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips, he saw the little

3	

3	3	Red-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl

3	

3	3	sprang out, crying: ‘Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it was

3	

3	3	inside the wolf’; and after that the aged grandmother came out alive

3	

3	3	also, but scarcely able to breathe. Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched

3	

3	3	great stones with which they filled the wolf’s belly, and when he awoke,

3	

3	3	he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at

3	

3	3	once, and fell dead.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf’s skin and

3	

3	3	went home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which

3	

3	3	Red-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap thought to herself: ‘As

3	

3	3	long as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the

3	

3	3	wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	It also related that once when Red-Cap was again taking cakes to the old

3	

3	3	grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the

3	

3	3	path. Red-Cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on

3	

3	3	her way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he

3	

3	3	had said ‘good morning’ to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes,

3	

3	3	that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would

3	

3	3	have eaten her up. ‘Well,’ said the grandmother, ‘we will shut the door,

3	

3	3	that he may not come in.’ Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried:

3	

3	3	‘Open the door, grandmother, I am Little Red-Cap, and am bringing you

3	

3	3	some cakes.’ But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard

3	

3	3	stole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof,

3	

3	3	intending to wait until Red-Cap went home in the evening, and then to

3	

3	3	steal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother

3	

3	3	saw what was in his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone

3	

3	3	trough, so she said to the child: ‘Take the pail, Red-Cap; I made some

3	

3	3	sausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the

3	

3	3	trough.’ Red-Cap carried until the great trough was quite full. Then the

3	

3	3	smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down,

3	

3	3	and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep

3	

3	3	his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight

3	

3	3	into the great trough, and was drowned. But Red-Cap went joyously home,

3	

3	3	and no one ever did anything to harm her again.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	THE ROBBER BRIDEGROOM

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter, and as she was

3	

3	3	grown up, he was anxious that she should be well married and provided

3	

3	3	for. He said to himself, ‘I will give her to the first suitable man who

3	

3	3	comes and asks for her hand.’ Not long after a suitor appeared, and as

3	

3	3	he appeared to be very rich and the miller could see nothing in him with

3	

3	3	which to find fault, he betrothed his daughter to him. But the girl did

3	

3	3	not care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband.

3	

3	3	She did not feel that she could trust him, and she could not look at him

3	

3	3	nor think of him without an inward shudder. One day he said to her, ‘You

3	

3	3	have not yet paid me a visit, although we have been betrothed for some

3	

3	3	time.’ ‘I do not know where your house is,’ she answered. ‘My house is

3	

3	3	out there in the dark forest,’ he said. She tried to excuse herself by

3	

3	3	saying that she would not be able to find the way thither. Her betrothed

3	

3	3	only replied, ‘You must come and see me next Sunday; I have already

3	

3	3	invited guests for that day, and that you may not mistake the way, I

3	

3	3	will strew ashes along the path.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When Sunday came, and it was time for the girl to start, a feeling of

3	

3	3	dread came over her which she could not explain, and that she might

3	

3	3	be able to find her path again, she filled her pockets with peas and

3	

3	3	lentils to sprinkle on the ground as she went along. On reaching the

3	

3	3	entrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes, and these

3	

3	3	she followed, throwing down some peas on either side of her at every

3	

3	3	step she took. She walked the whole day until she came to the deepest,

3	

3	3	darkest part of the forest. There she saw a lonely house, looking so

3	

3	3	grim and mysterious, that it did not please her at all. She stepped

3	

3	3	inside, but not a soul was to be seen, and a great silence reigned

3	

3	3	throughout. Suddenly a voice cried:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,

3	

3	3	  Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in a

3	

3	3	cage on the wall. Again it cried:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,

3	

3	3	  Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The girl passed on, going from room to room of the house, but they were

3	

3	3	all empty, and still she saw no one. At last she came to the cellar,

3	

3	3	and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head from

3	

3	3	shaking. ‘Can you tell me,’ asked the girl, ‘if my betrothed husband

3	

3	3	lives here?’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Ah, you poor child,’ answered the old woman, ‘what a place for you to

3	

3	3	come to! This is a murderers’ den. You think yourself a promised bride,

3	

3	3	and that your marriage will soon take place, but it is with death that

3	

3	3	you will keep your marriage feast. Look, do you see that large cauldron

3	

3	3	of water which I am obliged to keep on the fire! As soon as they have

3	

3	3	you in their power they will kill you without mercy, and cook and eat

3	

3	3	you, for they are eaters of men. If I did not take pity on you and save

3	

3	3	you, you would be lost.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Thereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask, which quite hid her

3	

3	3	from view. ‘Keep as still as a mouse,’ she said; ‘do not move or speak,

3	

3	3	or it will be all over with you. Tonight, when the robbers are

3	

3	3	all asleep, we will flee together. I have long been waiting for an

3	

3	3	opportunity to escape.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The words were hardly out of her mouth when the godless crew returned,

3	

3	3	dragging another young girl along with them. They were all drunk, and

3	

3	3	paid no heed to her cries and lamentations. They gave her wine to drink,

3	

3	3	three glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and one of yellow,

3	

3	3	and with that her heart gave way and she died. Then they tore off her

3	

3	3	dainty clothing, laid her on a table, and cut her beautiful body into

3	

3	3	pieces, and sprinkled salt upon it.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind the

3	

3	3	cask, for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her by

3	

3	3	the robbers. One of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining on

3	

3	3	the little finger of the murdered girl, and as he could not draw it off

3	

3	3	easily, he took a hatchet and cut off the finger; but the finger sprang

3	

3	3	into the air, and fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl who was

3	

3	3	hiding there. The robber took a light and began looking for it, but he

3	

3	3	could not find it. ‘Have you looked behind the large cask?’ said one of

3	

3	3	the others. But the old woman called out, ‘Come and eat your suppers,

3	

3	3	and let the thing be till tomorrow; the finger won’t run away.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘The old woman is right,’ said the robbers, and they ceased looking for

3	

3	3	the finger and sat down.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with their wine, and before

3	

3	3	long they were all lying on the floor of the cellar, fast asleep and

3	

3	3	snoring. As soon as the girl was assured of this, she came from behind

3	

3	3	the cask. She was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers, who

3	

3	3	were lying close together, and every moment she was filled with renewed

3	

3	3	dread lest she should awaken them. But God helped her, so that she

3	

3	3	passed safely over them, and then she and the old woman went upstairs,

3	

3	3	opened the door, and hastened as fast as they could from the murderers’

3	

3	3	den. They found the ashes scattered by the wind, but the peas and

3	

3	3	lentils had sprouted, and grown sufficiently above the ground, to guide

3	

3	3	them in the moonlight along the path. All night long they walked, and it

3	

3	3	was morning before they reached the mill. Then the girl told her father

3	

3	3	all that had happened.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The day came that had been fixed for the marriage. The bridegroom

3	

3	3	arrived and also a large company of guests, for the miller had taken

3	

3	3	care to invite all his friends and relations. As they sat at the feast,

3	

3	3	each guest in turn was asked to tell a tale; the bride sat still and did

3	

3	3	not say a word.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘And you, my love,’ said the bridegroom, turning to her, ‘is there no

3	

3	3	tale you know? Tell us something.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘I will tell you a dream, then,’ said the bride. ‘I went alone through a

3	

3	3	forest and came at last to a house; not a soul could I find within, but

3	

3	3	a bird that was hanging in a cage on the wall cried:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,

3	

3	3	  Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	and again a second time it said these words.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘My darling, this is only a dream.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘I went on through the house from room to room, but they were all empty,

3	

3	3	and everything was so grim and mysterious. At last I went down to the

3	

3	3	cellar, and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her

3	

3	3	head still. I asked her if my betrothed lived here, and she answered,

3	

3	3	“Ah, you poor child, you are come to a murderers’ den; your betrothed

3	

3	3	does indeed live here, but he will kill you without mercy and afterwards

3	

3	3	cook and eat you.”’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘My darling, this is only a dream.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘The old woman hid me behind a large cask, and scarcely had she done

3	

3	3	this when the robbers returned home, dragging a young girl along with

3	

3	3	them. They gave her three kinds of wine to drink, white, red, and

3	

3	3	yellow, and with that she died.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘My darling, this is only a dream.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Then they tore off her dainty clothing, and cut her beautiful body into

3	

3	3	pieces and sprinkled salt upon it.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘My darling, this is only a dream.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘And one of the robbers saw that there was a gold ring still left on her

3	

3	3	finger, and as it was difficult to draw off, he took a hatchet and cut

3	

3	3	off her finger; but the finger sprang into the air and fell behind the

3	

3	3	great cask into my lap. And here is the finger with the ring.’ And

3	

3	3	with these words the bride drew forth the finger and shewed it to the

3	

3	3	assembled guests.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The bridegroom, who during this recital had grown deadly pale, up and

3	

3	3	tried to escape, but the guests seized him and held him fast. They

3	

3	3	delivered him up to justice, and he and all his murderous band were

3	

3	3	condemned to death for their wicked deeds.

3

3	

3	3	TOM THUMB

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	A poor woodman sat in his cottage one night, smoking his pipe by the

3	

3	3	fireside, while his wife sat by his side spinning. ‘How lonely it is,

3	

3	3	wife,’ said he, as he puffed out a long curl of smoke, ‘for you and me

3	

3	3	to sit here by ourselves, without any children to play about and amuse

3	

3	3	us while other people seem so happy and merry with their children!’

3	

3	3	‘What you say is very true,’ said the wife, sighing, and turning round

3	

3	3	her wheel; ‘how happy should I be if I had but one child! If it were

3	

3	3	ever so small--nay, if it were no bigger than my thumb--I should be very

3	

3	3	happy, and love it dearly.’ Now--odd as you may think it--it came to

3	

3	3	pass that this good woman’s wish was fulfilled, just in the very way she

3	

3	3	had wished it; for, not long afterwards, she had a little boy, who was

3	

3	3	quite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb. So

3	

3	3	they said, ‘Well, we cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and,

3	

3	3	little as he is, we will love him dearly.’ And they called him Thomas

3	

3	3	Thumb.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	They gave him plenty of food, yet for all they could do he never grew

3	

3	3	bigger, but kept just the same size as he had been when he was born.

3	

3	3	Still, his eyes were sharp and sparkling, and he soon showed himself to

3	

3	3	be a clever little fellow, who always knew well what he was about.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	One day, as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cut

3	

3	3	fuel, he said, ‘I wish I had someone to bring the cart after me, for I

3	

3	3	want to make haste.’ ‘Oh, father,’ cried Tom, ‘I will take care of that;

3	

3	3	the cart shall be in the wood by the time you want it.’ Then the woodman

3	

3	3	laughed, and said, ‘How can that be? you cannot reach up to the horse’s

3	

3	3	bridle.’ ‘Never mind that, father,’ said Tom; ‘if my mother will only

3	

3	3	harness the horse, I will get into his ear and tell him which way to

3	

3	3	go.’ ‘Well,’ said the father, ‘we will try for once.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart, and put

3	

3	3	Tom into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the beast how

3	

3	3	to go, crying out, ‘Go on!’ and ‘Stop!’ as he wanted: and thus the horse

3	

3	3	went on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the

3	

3	3	wood. It happened that as the horse was going a little too fast, and Tom

3	

3	3	was calling out, ‘Gently! gently!’ two strangers came up. ‘What an odd

3	

3	3	thing that is!’ said one: ‘there is a cart going along, and I hear a

3	

3	3	carter talking to the horse, but yet I can see no one.’ ‘That is queer,

3	

3	3	indeed,’ said the other; ‘let us follow the cart, and see where it

3	

3	3	goes.’ So they went on into the wood, till at last they came to the

3	

3	3	place where the woodman was. Then Tom Thumb, seeing his father, cried

3	

3	3	out, ‘See, father, here I am with the cart, all right and safe! now take

3	

3	3	me down!’ So his father took hold of the horse with one hand, and with

3	

3	3	the other took his son out of the horse’s ear, and put him down upon a

3	

3	3	straw, where he sat as merry as you please.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The two strangers were all this time looking on, and did not know what

3	

3	3	to say for wonder. At last one took the other aside, and said, ‘That

3	

3	3	little urchin will make our fortune, if we can get him, and carry him

3	

3	3	about from town to town as a show; we must buy him.’ So they went up to

3	

3	3	the woodman, and asked him what he would take for the little man. ‘He

3	

3	3	will be better off,’ said they, ‘with us than with you.’ ‘I won’t sell

3	

3	3	him at all,’ said the father; ‘my own flesh and blood is dearer to me

3	

3	3	than all the silver and gold in the world.’ But Tom, hearing of the

3	

3	3	bargain they wanted to make, crept up his father’s coat to his shoulder

3	

3	3	and whispered in his ear, ‘Take the money, father, and let them have me;

3	

3	3	I’ll soon come back to you.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	So the woodman at last said he would sell Tom to the strangers for a

3	

3	3	large piece of gold, and they paid the price. ‘Where would you like to

3	

3	3	sit?’ said one of them. ‘Oh, put me on the rim of your hat; that will be

3	

3	3	a nice gallery for me; I can walk about there and see the country as we

3	

3	3	go along.’ So they did as he wished; and when Tom had taken leave of his

3	

3	3	father they took him away with them.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	They journeyed on till it began to be dusky, and then the little man

3	

3	3	said, ‘Let me get down, I’m tired.’ So the man took off his hat, and

3	

3	3	put him down on a clod of earth, in a ploughed field by the side of the

3	

3	3	road. But Tom ran about amongst the furrows, and at last slipped into

3	

3	3	an old mouse-hole. ‘Good night, my masters!’ said he, ‘I’m off! mind and

3	

3	3	look sharp after me the next time.’ Then they ran at once to the place,

3	

3	3	and poked the ends of their sticks into the mouse-hole, but all in vain;

3	

3	3	Tom only crawled farther and farther in; and at last it became quite

3	

3	3	dark, so that they were forced to go their way without their prize, as

3	

3	3	sulky as could be.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When Tom found they were gone, he came out of his hiding-place. ‘What

3	

3	3	dangerous walking it is,’ said he, ‘in this ploughed field! If I were to

3	

3	3	fall from one of these great clods, I should undoubtedly break my neck.’

3	

3	3	At last, by good luck, he found a large empty snail-shell. ‘This is

3	

3	3	lucky,’ said he, ‘I can sleep here very well’; and in he crept.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Just as he was falling asleep, he heard two men passing by, chatting

3	

3	3	together; and one said to the other, ‘How can we rob that rich parson’s

3	

3	3	house of his silver and gold?’ ‘I’ll tell you!’ cried Tom. ‘What noise

3	

3	3	was that?’ said the thief, frightened; ‘I’m sure I heard someone speak.’

3	

3	3	They stood still listening, and Tom said, ‘Take me with you, and I’ll

3	

3	3	soon show you how to get the parson’s money.’ ‘But where are you?’ said

3	

3	3	they. ‘Look about on the ground,’ answered he, ‘and listen where the

3	

3	3	sound comes from.’ At last the thieves found him out, and lifted him

3	

3	3	up in their hands. ‘You little urchin!’ they said, ‘what can you do for

3	

3	3	us?’ ‘Why, I can get between the iron window-bars of the parson’s house,

3	

3	3	and throw you out whatever you want.’ ‘That’s a good thought,’ said the

3	

3	3	thieves; ‘come along, we shall see what you can do.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When they came to the parson’s house, Tom slipped through the

3	

3	3	window-bars into the room, and then called out as loud as he could bawl,

3	

3	3	‘Will you have all that is here?’ At this the thieves were frightened,

3	

3	3	and said, ‘Softly, softly! Speak low, that you may not awaken anybody.’

3	

3	3	But Tom seemed as if he did not understand them, and bawled out again,

3	

3	3	‘How much will you have? Shall I throw it all out?’ Now the cook lay in

3	

3	3	the next room; and hearing a noise she raised herself up in her bed and

3	

3	3	listened. Meantime the thieves were frightened, and ran off a little

3	

3	3	way; but at last they plucked up their hearts, and said, ‘The little

3	

3	3	urchin is only trying to make fools of us.’ So they came back and

3	

3	3	whispered softly to him, saying, ‘Now let us have no more of your

3	

3	3	roguish jokes; but throw us out some of the money.’ Then Tom called out

3	

3	3	as loud as he could, ‘Very well! hold your hands! here it comes.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The cook heard this quite plain, so she sprang out of bed, and ran to

3	

3	3	open the door. The thieves ran off as if a wolf was at their tails: and

3	

3	3	the maid, having groped about and found nothing, went away for a light.

3	

3	3	By the time she came back, Tom had slipped off into the barn; and when

3	

3	3	she had looked about and searched every hole and corner, and found

3	

3	3	nobody, she went to bed, thinking she must have been dreaming with her

3	

3	3	eyes open.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The little man crawled about in the hay-loft, and at last found a snug

3	

3	3	place to finish his night’s rest in; so he laid himself down, meaning

3	

3	3	to sleep till daylight, and then find his way home to his father and

3	

3	3	mother. But alas! how woefully he was undone! what crosses and sorrows

3	

3	3	happen to us all in this world! The cook got up early, before daybreak,

3	

3	3	to feed the cows; and going straight to the hay-loft, carried away

3	

3	3	a large bundle of hay, with the little man in the middle of it, fast

3	

3	3	asleep. He still, however, slept on, and did not awake till he found

3	

3	3	himself in the mouth of the cow; for the cook had put the hay into the

3	

3	3	cow’s rick, and the cow had taken Tom up in a mouthful of it. ‘Good

3	

3	3	lack-a-day!’ said he, ‘how came I to tumble into the mill?’ But he soon

3	

3	3	found out where he really was; and was forced to have all his wits about

3	

3	3	him, that he might not get between the cow’s teeth, and so be crushed to

3	

3	3	death. At last down he went into her stomach. ‘It is rather dark,’ said

3	

3	3	he; ‘they forgot to build windows in this room to let the sun in; a

3	

3	3	candle would be no bad thing.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Though he made the best of his bad luck, he did not like his quarters at

3	

3	3	all; and the worst of it was, that more and more hay was always coming

3	

3	3	down, and the space left for him became smaller and smaller. At last he

3	

3	3	cried out as loud as he could, ‘Don’t bring me any more hay! Don’t bring

3	

3	3	me any more hay!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The maid happened to be just then milking the cow; and hearing someone

3	

3	3	speak, but seeing nobody, and yet being quite sure it was the same voice

3	

3	3	that she had heard in the night, she was so frightened that she fell off

3	

3	3	her stool, and overset the milk-pail. As soon as she could pick herself

3	

3	3	up out of the dirt, she ran off as fast as she could to her master the

3	

3	3	parson, and said, ‘Sir, sir, the cow is talking!’ But the parson

3	

3	3	said, ‘Woman, thou art surely mad!’ However, he went with her into the

3	

3	3	cow-house, to try and see what was the matter.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Scarcely had they set foot on the threshold, when Tom called out, ‘Don’t

3	

3	3	bring me any more hay!’ Then the parson himself was frightened; and

3	

3	3	thinking the cow was surely bewitched, told his man to kill her on the

3	

3	3	spot. So the cow was killed, and cut up; and the stomach, in which Tom

3	

3	3	lay, was thrown out upon a dunghill.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Tom soon set himself to work to get out, which was not a very easy

3	

3	3	task; but at last, just as he had made room to get his head out, fresh

3	

3	3	ill-luck befell him. A hungry wolf sprang out, and swallowed up the

3	

3	3	whole stomach, with Tom in it, at one gulp, and ran away.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Tom, however, was still not disheartened; and thinking the wolf would

3	

3	3	not dislike having some chat with him as he was going along, he called

3	

3	3	out, ‘My good friend, I can show you a famous treat.’ ‘Where’s that?’

3	

3	3	said the wolf. ‘In such and such a house,’ said Tom, describing his own

3	

3	3	father’s house. ‘You can crawl through the drain into the kitchen and

3	

3	3	then into the pantry, and there you will find cakes, ham, beef, cold

3	

3	3	chicken, roast pig, apple-dumplings, and everything that your heart can

3	

3	3	wish.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The wolf did not want to be asked twice; so that very night he went to

3	

3	3	the house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen, and then into

3	

3	3	the pantry, and ate and drank there to his heart’s content. As soon as

3	

3	3	he had had enough he wanted to get away; but he had eaten so much that

3	

3	3	he could not go out by the same way he came in.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	This was just what Tom had reckoned upon; and now he began to set up a

3	

3	3	great shout, making all the noise he could. ‘Will you be easy?’ said the

3	

3	3	wolf; ‘you’ll awaken everybody in the house if you make such a clatter.’

3	

3	3	‘What’s that to me?’ said the little man; ‘you have had your frolic, now

3	

3	3	I’ve a mind to be merry myself’; and he began, singing and shouting as

3	

3	3	loud as he could.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The woodman and his wife, being awakened by the noise, peeped through

3	

3	3	a crack in the door; but when they saw a wolf was there, you may well

3	

3	3	suppose that they were sadly frightened; and the woodman ran for his

3	

3	3	axe, and gave his wife a scythe. ‘Do you stay behind,’ said the woodman,

3	

3	3	‘and when I have knocked him on the head you must rip him up with the

3	

3	3	scythe.’ Tom heard all this, and cried out, ‘Father, father! I am here,

3	

3	3	the wolf has swallowed me.’ And his father said, ‘Heaven be praised! we

3	

3	3	have found our dear child again’; and he told his wife not to use the

3	

3	3	scythe for fear she should hurt him. Then he aimed a great blow, and

3	

3	3	struck the wolf on the head, and killed him on the spot! and when he was

3	

3	3	dead they cut open his body, and set Tommy free. ‘Ah!’ said the father,

3	

3	3	‘what fears we have had for you!’ ‘Yes, father,’ answered he; ‘I have

3	

3	3	travelled all over the world, I think, in one way or other, since we

3	

3	3	parted; and now I am very glad to come home and get fresh air again.’

3	

3	3	‘Why, where have you been?’ said his father. ‘I have been in a

3	

3	3	mouse-hole--and in a snail-shell--and down a cow’s throat--and in the

3	

3	3	wolf’s belly; and yet here I am again, safe and sound.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Well,’ said they, ‘you are come back, and we will not sell you again

3	

3	3	for all the riches in the world.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then they hugged and kissed their dear little son, and gave him plenty

3	

3	3	to eat and drink, for he was very hungry; and then they fetched new

3	

3	3	clothes for him, for his old ones had been quite spoiled on his journey.

3	

3	3	So Master Thumb stayed at home with his father and mother, in peace; for

3	

3	3	though he had been so great a traveller, and had done and seen so many

3	

3	3	fine things, and was fond enough of telling the whole story, he always

3	

3	3	agreed that, after all, there’s no place like HOME!

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	RUMPELSTILTSKIN

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	By the side of a wood, in a country a long way off, ran a fine stream

3	

3	3	of water; and upon the stream there stood a mill. The miller’s house was

3	

3	3	close by, and the miller, you must know, had a very beautiful daughter.

3	

3	3	She was, moreover, very shrewd and clever; and the miller was so proud

3	

3	3	of her, that he one day told the king of the land, who used to come and

3	

3	3	hunt in the wood, that his daughter could spin gold out of straw. Now

3	

3	3	this king was very fond of money; and when he heard the miller’s boast

3	

3	3	his greediness was raised, and he sent for the girl to be brought before

3	

3	3	him. Then he led her to a chamber in his palace where there was a great

3	

3	3	heap of straw, and gave her a spinning-wheel, and said, ‘All this must

3	

3	3	be spun into gold before morning, as you love your life.’ It was in vain

3	

3	3	that the poor maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her father,

3	

3	3	for that she could do no such thing as spin straw into gold: the chamber

3	

3	3	door was locked, and she was left alone.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	She sat down in one corner of the room, and began to bewail her hard

3	

3	3	fate; when on a sudden the door opened, and a droll-looking little man

3	

3	3	hobbled in, and said, ‘Good morrow to you, my good lass; what are you

3	

3	3	weeping for?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘I must spin this straw into gold, and

3	

3	3	I know not how.’ ‘What will you give me,’ said the hobgoblin, ‘to do it

3	

3	3	for you?’ ‘My necklace,’ replied the maiden. He took her at her word,

3	

3	3	and sat himself down to the wheel, and whistled and sang:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Round about, round about,

3	

3	3	    Lo and behold!

3	

3	3	  Reel away, reel away,

3	

3	3	    Straw into gold!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And round about the wheel went merrily; the work was quickly done, and

3	

3	3	the straw was all spun into gold.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When the king came and saw this, he was greatly astonished and pleased;

3	

3	3	but his heart grew still more greedy of gain, and he shut up the poor

3	

3	3	miller’s daughter again with a fresh task. Then she knew not what to do,

3	

3	3	and sat down once more to weep; but the dwarf soon opened the door, and

3	

3	3	said, ‘What will you give me to do your task?’ ‘The ring on my finger,’

3	

3	3	said she. So her little friend took the ring, and began to work at the

3	

3	3	wheel again, and whistled and sang:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Round about, round about,

3	

3	3	    Lo and behold!

3	

3	3	  Reel away, reel away,

3	

3	3	    Straw into gold!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	till, long before morning, all was done again.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The king was greatly delighted to see all this glittering treasure;

3	

3	3	but still he had not enough: so he took the miller’s daughter to a yet

3	

3	3	larger heap, and said, ‘All this must be spun tonight; and if it is,

3	

3	3	you shall be my queen.’ As soon as she was alone that dwarf came in, and

3	

3	3	said, ‘What will you give me to spin gold for you this third time?’

3	

3	3	‘I have nothing left,’ said she. ‘Then say you will give me,’ said

3	

3	3	the little man, ‘the first little child that you may have when you are

3	

3	3	queen.’ ‘That may never be,’ thought the miller’s daughter: and as she

3	

3	3	knew no other way to get her task done, she said she would do what he

3	

3	3	asked. Round went the wheel again to the old song, and the manikin once

3	

3	3	more spun the heap into gold. The king came in the morning, and, finding

3	

3	3	all he wanted, was forced to keep his word; so he married the miller’s

3	

3	3	daughter, and she really became queen.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	At the birth of her first little child she was very glad, and forgot the

3	

3	3	dwarf, and what she had said. But one day he came into her room, where

3	

3	3	she was sitting playing with her baby, and put her in mind of it. Then

3	

3	3	she grieved sorely at her misfortune, and said she would give him all

3	

3	3	the wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off, but in vain; till at

3	

3	3	last her tears softened him, and he said, ‘I will give you three days’

3	

3	3	grace, and if during that time you tell me my name, you shall keep your

3	

3	3	child.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Now the queen lay awake all night, thinking of all the odd names that

3	

3	3	she had ever heard; and she sent messengers all over the land to find

3	

3	3	out new ones. The next day the little man came, and she began with

3	

3	3	TIMOTHY, ICHABOD, BENJAMIN, JEREMIAH, and all the names she could

3	

3	3	remember; but to all and each of them he said, ‘Madam, that is not my

3	

3	3	name.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The second day she began with all the comical names she could hear of,

3	

3	3	BANDY-LEGS, HUNCHBACK, CROOK-SHANKS, and so on; but the little gentleman

3	

3	3	still said to every one of them, ‘Madam, that is not my name.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The third day one of the messengers came back, and said, ‘I have

3	

3	3	travelled two days without hearing of any other names; but yesterday, as

3	

3	3	I was climbing a high hill, among the trees of the forest where the fox

3	

3	3	and the hare bid each other good night, I saw a little hut; and before

3	

3	3	the hut burnt a fire; and round about the fire a funny little dwarf was

3	

3	3	dancing upon one leg, and singing:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 “Merrily the feast I’ll make.

3	

3	3	  Today I’ll brew, tomorrow bake;

3	

3	3	  Merrily I’ll dance and sing,

3	

3	3	  For next day will a stranger bring.

3	

3	3	  Little does my lady dream

3	

3	3	  Rumpelstiltskin is my name!”

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When the queen heard this she jumped for joy, and as soon as her little

3	

3	3	friend came she sat down upon her throne, and called all her court round

3	

3	3	to enjoy the fun; and the nurse stood by her side with the baby in her

3	

3	3	arms, as if it was quite ready to be given up. Then the little man began

3	

3	3	to chuckle at the thought of having the poor child, to take home with

3	

3	3	him to his hut in the woods; and he cried out, ‘Now, lady, what is my

3	

3	3	name?’ ‘Is it JOHN?’ asked she. ‘No, madam!’ ‘Is it TOM?’ ‘No, madam!’

3	

3	3	‘Is it JEMMY?’ ‘It is not.’ ‘Can your name be RUMPELSTILTSKIN?’ said the

3	

3	3	lady slyly. ‘Some witch told you that!--some witch told you that!’ cried

3	

3	3	the little man, and dashed his right foot in a rage so deep into the

3	

3	3	floor, that he was forced to lay hold of it with both hands to pull it

3	

3	3	out.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then he made the best of his way off, while the nurse laughed and the

3	

3	3	baby crowed; and all the court jeered at him for having had so much

3	

3	3	trouble for nothing, and said, ‘We wish you a very good morning, and a

3	

3	3	merry feast, Mr RUMPLESTILTSKIN!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	CLEVER GRETEL

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and

3	

3	3	when she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that,

3	

3	3	was quite happy and thought: ‘You certainly are a pretty girl!’ And when

3	

3	3	she came home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught of wine,

3	

3	3	and as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever she

3	

3	3	was cooking until she was satisfied, and said: ‘The cook must know what

3	

3	3	the food is like.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	It came to pass that the master one day said to her: ‘Gretel, there is a

3	

3	3	guest coming this evening; prepare me two fowls very daintily.’ ‘I will

3	

3	3	see to it, master,’ answered Gretel. She killed two fowls, scalded them,

3	

3	3	plucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before

3	

3	3	the fire, that they might roast. The fowls began to turn brown, and were

3	

3	3	nearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived. Then Gretel called out

3	

3	3	to her master: ‘If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away

3	

3	3	from the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten

3	

3	3	the moment they are at their juiciest.’ The master said: ‘I will run

3	

3	3	myself, and fetch the guest.’ When the master had turned his back,

3	

3	3	Gretel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and thought: ‘Standing

3	

3	3	so long by the fire there, makes one sweat and thirsty; who knows

3	

3	3	when they will come? Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a

3	

3	3	drink.’ She ran down, set a jug, said: ‘God bless it for you, Gretel,’

3	

3	3	and took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should

3	

3	3	not be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them,

3	

3	3	and drove the spit merrily round. But as the roast meat smelt so good,

3	

3	3	Gretel thought: ‘Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!’

3	

3	3	She touched it with her finger, and said: ‘Ah! how good fowls are! It

3	

3	3	certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right

3	

3	3	time!’ She ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with

3	

3	3	his guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the fowls and thought:

3	

3	3	‘One of the wings is burning! I had better take it off and eat it.’

3	

3	3	So she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she

3	

3	3	thought: ‘The other must go down too, or else master will observe that

3	

3	3	something is missing.’ When the two wings were eaten, she went and

3	

3	3	looked for her master, and did not see him. It suddenly occurred to

3	

3	3	her: ‘Who knows? They are perhaps not coming at all, and have turned in

3	

3	3	somewhere.’ Then she said: ‘Well, Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has

3	

3	3	been cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is

3	

3	3	eaten you will have some peace, why should God’s good gifts be spoilt?’

3	

3	3	So she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the

3	

3	3	one chicken in great glee. When one of the chickens was swallowed down,

3	

3	3	and still her master did not come, Gretel looked at the other and said:

3	

3	3	‘What one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what’s

3	

3	3	right for the one is right for the other; I think if I were to take

3	

3	3	another draught it would do me no harm.’ So she took another hearty

3	

3	3	drink, and let the second chicken follow the first.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	While she was making the most of it, her master came and cried: ‘Hurry

3	

3	3	up, Gretel, the guest is coming directly after me!’ ‘Yes, sir, I will

3	

3	3	soon serve up,’ answered Gretel. Meantime the master looked to see that

3	

3	3	the table was properly laid, and took the great knife, wherewith he was

3	

3	3	going to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on the steps. Presently

3	

3	3	the guest came, and knocked politely and courteously at the house-door.

3	

3	3	Gretel ran, and looked to see who was there, and when she saw the guest,

3	

3	3	she put her finger to her lips and said: ‘Hush! hush! go away as quickly

3	

3	3	as you can, if my master catches you it will be the worse for you; he

3	

3	3	certainly did ask you to supper, but his intention is to cut off your

3	

3	3	two ears. Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!’ The guest

3	

3	3	heard the sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he

3	

3	3	could. Gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried:

3	

3	3	‘You have invited a fine guest!’ ‘Why, Gretel? What do you mean by

3	

3	3	that?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘he has taken the chickens which I was just

3	

3	3	going to serve up, off the dish, and has run away with them!’ ‘That’s a

3	

3	3	nice trick!’ said her master, and lamented the fine chickens. ‘If he had

3	

3	3	but left me one, so that something remained for me to eat.’ He called to

3	

3	3	him to stop, but the guest pretended not to hear. Then he ran after him

3	

3	3	with the knife still in his hand, crying: ‘Just one, just one,’ meaning

3	

3	3	that the guest should leave him just one chicken, and not take both. The

3	

3	3	guest, however, thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of

3	

3	3	his ears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take

3	

3	3	them both with him.

3	

3	3	THE OLD MAN AND HIS GRANDSON

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull

3	

3	3	of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly

3	

3	3	hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run

3	

3	3	out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so

3	

3	3	the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,

3	

3	3	and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough

3	

3	3	of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of

3	

3	3	tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it

3	

3	3	fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said

3	

3	3	nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few

3	

3	3	half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old

3	

3	3	began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are

3	

3	3	you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’

3	

3	3	answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently

3	

3	3	began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and

3	

3	3	henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he

3	

3	3	did spill a little of anything.

3

3	

3	3	THE LITTLE PEASANT

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich

3	

3	3	peasants, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant. He

3	

3	3	had not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and

3	

3	3	yet he and his wife did so wish to have one. One day he said to her:

3	

3	3	‘Listen, I have a good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall

3	

3	3	make us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like any

3	

3	3	other, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow.’ the woman

3	

3	3	also liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed

3	

3	3	the calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its head

3	

3	3	hanging down as if it were eating.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Next morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant

3	

3	3	called the cow-herd in and said: ‘Look, I have a little calf there,

3	

3	3	but it is still small and has to be carried.’ The cow-herd said: ‘All

3	

3	3	right,’ and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set

3	

3	3	it among the grass. The little calf always remained standing like one

3	

3	3	which was eating, and the cow-herd said: ‘It will soon run by itself,

3	

3	3	just look how it eats already!’ At night when he was going to drive the

3	

3	3	herd home again, he said to the calf: ‘If you can stand there and eat

3	

3	3	your fill, you can also go on your four legs; I don’t care to drag you

3	

3	3	home again in my arms.’ But the little peasant stood at his door, and

3	

3	3	waited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through

3	

3	3	the village, and the calf was missing, he inquired where it was. The

3	

3	3	cow-herd answered: ‘It is still standing out there eating. It would not

3	

3	3	stop and come with us.’ But the little peasant said: ‘Oh, but I must

3	

3	3	have my beast back again.’ Then they went back to the meadow together,

3	

3	3	but someone had stolen the calf, and it was gone. The cow-herd said: ‘It

3	

3	3	must have run away.’ The peasant, however, said: ‘Don’t tell me

3	

3	3	that,’ and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his carelessness

3	

3	3	condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had

3	

3	3	so long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for

3	

3	3	it, and could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed. They

3	

3	3	salted the flesh, and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell

3	

3	3	the skin there, so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds. On

3	

3	3	the way he passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings,

3	

3	3	and out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin. But as the

3	

3	3	weather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could

3	

3	3	go no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter. The

3	

3	3	miller’s wife was alone in the house, and said to the peasant: ‘Lay

3	

3	3	yourself on the straw there,’ and gave him a slice of bread and cheese.

3	

3	3	The peasant ate it, and lay down with his skin beside him, and the woman

3	

3	3	thought: ‘He is tired and has gone to sleep.’ In the meantime came the

3	

3	3	parson; the miller’s wife received him well, and said: ‘My husband is

3	

3	3	out, so we will have a feast.’ The peasant listened, and when he heard

3	

3	3	them talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make

3	

3	3	shift with a slice of bread and cheese. Then the woman served up four

3	

3	3	different things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Just as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking

3	

3	3	outside. The woman said: ‘Oh, heavens! It is my husband!’ she quickly

3	

3	3	hid the roast meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the pillow,

3	

3	3	the salad on the bed, the cakes under it, and the parson in the closet

3	

3	3	on the porch. Then she opened the door for her husband, and said: ‘Thank

3	

3	3	heaven, you are back again! There is such a storm, it looks as if the

3	

3	3	world were coming to an end.’ The miller saw the peasant lying on the

3	

3	3	straw, and asked, ‘What is that fellow doing there?’ ‘Ah,’ said the

3	

3	3	wife, ‘the poor knave came in the storm and rain, and begged for

3	

3	3	shelter, so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese, and showed him where

3	

3	3	the straw was.’ The man said: ‘I have no objection, but be quick and get

3	

3	3	me something to eat.’ The woman said: ‘But I have nothing but bread and

3	

3	3	cheese.’ ‘I am contented with anything,’ replied the husband, ‘so far as

3	

3	3	I am concerned, bread and cheese will do,’ and looked at the peasant and

3	

3	3	said: ‘Come and eat some more with me.’ The peasant did not require to

3	

3	3	be invited twice, but got up and ate. After this the miller saw the skin

3	

3	3	in which the raven was, lying on the ground, and asked: ‘What have you

3	

3	3	there?’ The peasant answered: ‘I have a soothsayer inside it.’ ‘Can

3	

3	3	he foretell anything to me?’ said the miller. ‘Why not?’ answered

3	

3	3	the peasant: ‘but he only says four things, and the fifth he keeps to

3	

3	3	himself.’ The miller was curious, and said: ‘Let him foretell something

3	

3	3	for once.’ Then the peasant pinched the raven’s head, so that he croaked

3	

3	3	and made a noise like krr, krr. The miller said: ‘What did he say?’ The

3	

3	3	peasant answered: ‘In the first place, he says that there is some wine

3	

3	3	hidden under the pillow.’ ‘Bless me!’ cried the miller, and went there

3	

3	3	and found the wine. ‘Now go on,’ said he. The peasant made the raven

3	

3	3	croak again, and said: ‘In the second place, he says that there is some

3	

3	3	roast meat in the tiled stove.’ ‘Upon my word!’ cried the miller, and

3	

3	3	went thither, and found the roast meat. The peasant made the raven

3	

3	3	prophesy still more, and said: ‘Thirdly, he says that there is some

3	

3	3	salad on the bed.’ ‘That would be a fine thing!’ cried the miller, and

3	

3	3	went there and found the salad. At last the peasant pinched the raven

3	

3	3	once more till he croaked, and said: ‘Fourthly, he says that there

3	

3	3	are some cakes under the bed.’ ‘That would be a fine thing!’ cried the

3	

3	3	miller, and looked there, and found the cakes.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller’s wife

3	

3	3	was frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with

3	

3	3	her. The miller would have liked much to know the fifth, but the little

3	

3	3	peasant said: ‘First, we will quickly eat the four things, for the fifth

3	

3	3	is something bad.’ So they ate, and after that they bargained how much

3	

3	3	the miller was to give for the fifth prophecy, until they agreed on

3	

3	3	three hundred talers. Then the peasant once more pinched the raven’s

3	

3	3	head till he croaked loudly. The miller asked: ‘What did he say?’ The

3	

3	3	peasant replied: ‘He says that the Devil is hiding outside there in

3	

3	3	the closet on the porch.’ The miller said: ‘The Devil must go out,’ and

3	

3	3	opened the house-door; then the woman was forced to give up the keys,

3	

3	3	and the peasant unlocked the closet. The parson ran out as fast as he

3	

3	3	could, and the miller said: ‘It was true; I saw the black rascal with my

3	

3	3	own eyes.’ The peasant, however, made off next morning by daybreak with

3	

3	3	the three hundred talers.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	At home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful

3	

3	3	house, and the peasants said: ‘The small peasant has certainly been to

3	

3	3	the place where golden snow falls, and people carry the gold home in

3	

3	3	shovels.’ Then the small peasant was brought before the mayor, and

3	

3	3	bidden to say from whence his wealth came. He answered: ‘I sold my cow’s

3	

3	3	skin in the town, for three hundred talers.’ When the peasants heard

3	

3	3	that, they too wished to enjoy this great profit, and ran home, killed

3	

3	3	all their cows, and stripped off their skins in order to sell them in

3	

3	3	the town to the greatest advantage. The mayor, however, said: ‘But my

3	

3	3	servant must go first.’ When she came to the merchant in the town, he

3	

3	3	did not give her more than two talers for a skin, and when the others

3	

3	3	came, he did not give them so much, and said: ‘What can I do with all

3	

3	3	these skins?’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus

3	

3	3	outwitted them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused him of this

3	

3	3	treachery before the mayor. The innocent little peasant was unanimously

3	

3	3	sentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the water, in a barrel

3	

3	3	pierced full of holes. He was led forth, and a priest was brought who

3	

3	3	was to say a mass for his soul. The others were all obliged to retire to

3	

3	3	a distance, and when the peasant looked at the priest, he recognized the

3	

3	3	man who had been with the miller’s wife. He said to him: ‘I set you free

3	

3	3	from the closet, set me free from the barrel.’ At this same moment up

3	

3	3	came, with a flock of sheep, the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had

3	

3	3	long been wishing to be mayor, so he cried with all his might: ‘No, I

3	

3	3	will not do it; if the whole world insists on it, I will not do it!’ The

3	

3	3	shepherd hearing that, came up to him, and asked: ‘What are you about?

3	

3	3	What is it that you will not do?’ The peasant said: ‘They want to make

3	

3	3	me mayor, if I will but put myself in the barrel, but I will not do it.’

3	

3	3	The shepherd said: ‘If nothing more than that is needful in order to be

3	

3	3	mayor, I would get into the barrel at once.’ The peasant said: ‘If you

3	

3	3	will get in, you will be mayor.’ The shepherd was willing, and got in,

3	

3	3	and the peasant shut the top down on him; then he took the shepherd’s

3	

3	3	flock for himself, and drove it away. The parson went to the crowd,

3	

3	3	and declared that the mass had been said. Then they came and rolled the

3	

3	3	barrel towards the water. When the barrel began to roll, the shepherd

3	

3	3	cried: ‘I am quite willing to be mayor.’ They believed no otherwise than

3	

3	3	that it was the peasant who was saying this, and answered: ‘That is

3	

3	3	what we intend, but first you shall look about you a little down below

3	

3	3	there,’ and they rolled the barrel down into the water.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	After that the peasants went home, and as they were entering the

3	

3	3	village, the small peasant also came quietly in, driving a flock of

3	

3	3	sheep and looking quite contented. Then the peasants were astonished,

3	

3	3	and said: ‘Peasant, from whence do you come? Have you come out of the

3	

3	3	water?’ ‘Yes, truly,’ replied the peasant, ‘I sank deep, deep down,

3	

3	3	until at last I got to the bottom; I pushed the bottom out of the

3	

3	3	barrel, and crept out, and there were pretty meadows on which a number

3	

3	3	of lambs were feeding, and from thence I brought this flock away with

3	

3	3	me.’ Said the peasants: ‘Are there any more there?’ ‘Oh, yes,’ said he,

3	

3	3	‘more than I could want.’ Then the peasants made up their minds that

3	

3	3	they too would fetch some sheep for themselves, a flock apiece, but the

3	

3	3	mayor said: ‘I come first.’ So they went to the water together, and just

3	

3	3	then there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which

3	

3	3	are called little lambs, and they were reflected in the water, whereupon

3	

3	3	the peasants cried: ‘We already see the sheep down below!’ The mayor

3	

3	3	pressed forward and said: ‘I will go down first, and look about me, and

3	

3	3	if things promise well I’ll call you.’ So he jumped in; splash! went

3	

3	3	the water; it sounded as if he were calling them, and the whole crowd

3	

3	3	plunged in after him as one man. Then the entire village was dead, and

3	

3	3	the small peasant, as sole heir, became a rich man.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	FREDERICK AND CATHERINE

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name was

3	

3	3	Catherine, and they had not long been married. One day Frederick said.

3	

3	3	‘Kate! I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be

3	

3	3	hungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale.’

3	

3	3	‘Very well,’ said she, ‘it shall all be ready.’ When dinner-time drew

3	

3	3	nigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and

3	

3	3	put it on the fire to fry. The steak soon began to look brown, and to

3	

3	3	crackle in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it:

3	

3	3	then she said to herself, ‘The steak is almost ready, I may as well go

3	

3	3	to the cellar for the ale.’ So she left the pan on the fire and took a

3	

3	3	large jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. The beer ran

3	

3	3	into the jug and Catherine stood looking on. At last it popped into her

3	

3	3	head, ‘The dog is not shut up--he may be running away with the steak;

3	

3	3	that’s well thought of.’ So up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough

3	

3	3	the rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth, and was making off with

3	

3	3	it.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Away ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran

3	

3	3	faster than she, and stuck close to the steak. ‘It’s all gone, and “what

3	

3	3	can’t be cured must be endured”,’ said Catherine. So she turned round;

3	

3	3	and as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely

3	

3	3	to cool herself.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Now all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not turned

3	

3	3	the cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till

3	

3	3	the cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had

3	

3	3	happened. ‘My stars!’ said she, ‘what shall I do to keep Frederick from

3	

3	3	seeing all this slopping about?’ So she thought a while; and at last

3	

3	3	remembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair,

3	

3	3	and that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale

3	

3	3	nicely. ‘What a lucky thing,’ said she, ‘that we kept that meal! we have

3	

3	3	now a good use for it.’ So away she went for it: but she managed to set

3	

3	3	it down just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus

3	

3	3	all the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. ‘Ah!

3	

3	3	well,’ said she, ‘when one goes another may as well follow.’ Then she

3	

3	3	strewed the meal all about the cellar, and was quite pleased with her

3	

3	3	cleverness, and said, ‘How very neat and clean it looks!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	At noon Frederick came home. ‘Now, wife,’ cried he, ‘what have you for

3	

3	3	dinner?’ ‘O Frederick!’ answered she, ‘I was cooking you a steak; but

3	

3	3	while I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while

3	

3	3	I ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale

3	

3	3	with the sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but the

3	

3	3	cellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!’ ‘Kate, Kate,’ said he,

3	

3	3	‘how could you do all this?’ Why did you leave the steak to fry, and the

3	

3	3	ale to run, and then spoil all the meal?’ ‘Why, Frederick,’ said she, ‘I

3	

3	3	did not know I was doing wrong; you should have told me before.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The husband thought to himself, ‘If my wife manages matters thus, I must

3	

3	3	look sharp myself.’ Now he had a good deal of gold in the house: so he

3	

3	3	said to Catherine, ‘What pretty yellow buttons these are! I shall put

3	

3	3	them into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you

3	

3	3	never go near or meddle with them.’ ‘No, Frederick,’ said she, ‘that

3	

3	3	I never will.’ As soon as he was gone, there came by some pedlars with

3	

3	3	earthenware plates and dishes, and they asked her whether she would buy.

3	

3	3	‘Oh dear me, I should like to buy very much, but I have no money: if

3	

3	3	you had any use for yellow buttons, I might deal with you.’ ‘Yellow

3	

3	3	buttons!’ said they: ‘let us have a look at them.’ ‘Go into the garden

3	

3	3	and dig where I tell you, and you will find the yellow buttons: I dare

3	

3	3	not go myself.’ So the rogues went: and when they found what these

3	

3	3	yellow buttons were, they took them all away, and left her plenty of

3	

3	3	plates and dishes. Then she set them all about the house for a show:

3	

3	3	and when Frederick came back, he cried out, ‘Kate, what have you been

3	

3	3	doing?’ ‘See,’ said she, ‘I have bought all these with your yellow

3	

3	3	buttons: but I did not touch them myself; the pedlars went themselves

3	

3	3	and dug them up.’ ‘Wife, wife,’ said Frederick, ‘what a pretty piece of

3	

3	3	work you have made! those yellow buttons were all my money: how came you

3	

3	3	to do such a thing?’ ‘Why,’ answered she, ‘I did not know there was any

3	

3	3	harm in it; you should have told me.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Catherine stood musing for a while, and at last said to her husband,

3	

3	3	‘Hark ye, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back: let us run after

3	

3	3	the thieves.’ ‘Well, we will try,’ answered he; ‘but take some butter

3	

3	3	and cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.’

3	

3	3	‘Very well,’ said she; and they set out: and as Frederick walked the

3	

3	3	fastest, he left his wife some way behind. ‘It does not matter,’ thought

3	

3	3	she: ‘when we turn back, I shall be so much nearer home than he.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Presently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there

3	

3	3	was a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees

3	

3	3	on each side as they passed. ‘Ah, see now,’ said she, ‘how they have

3	

3	3	bruised and wounded those poor trees; they will never get well.’ So she

3	

3	3	took pity on them, and made use of the butter to grease them all, so

3	

3	3	that the wheels might not hurt them so much. While she was doing this

3	

3	3	kind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket, and rolled down

3	

3	3	the hill. Catherine looked, but could not see where it had gone; so she

3	

3	3	said, ‘Well, I suppose the other will go the same way and find you; he

3	

3	3	has younger legs than I have.’ Then she rolled the other cheese after

3	

3	3	it; and away it went, nobody knows where, down the hill. But she said

3	

3	3	she supposed that they knew the road, and would follow her, and she

3	

3	3	could not stay there all day waiting for them.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	At last she overtook Frederick, who desired her to give him something to

3	

3	3	eat. Then she gave him the dry bread. ‘Where are the butter and cheese?’

3	

3	3	said he. ‘Oh!’ answered she, ‘I used the butter to grease those poor

3	

3	3	trees that the wheels chafed so: and one of the cheeses ran away so I

3	

3	3	sent the other after it to find it, and I suppose they are both on

3	

3	3	the road together somewhere.’ ‘What a goose you are to do such silly

3	

3	3	things!’ said the husband. ‘How can you say so?’ said she; ‘I am sure

3	

3	3	you never told me not.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	They ate the dry bread together; and Frederick said, ‘Kate, I hope you

3	

3	3	locked the door safe when you came away.’ ‘No,’ answered she, ‘you did

3	

3	3	not tell me.’ ‘Then go home, and do it now before we go any farther,’

3	

3	3	said Frederick, ‘and bring with you something to eat.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Catherine did as he told her, and thought to herself by the way,

3	

3	3	‘Frederick wants something to eat; but I don’t think he is very fond of

3	

3	3	butter and cheese: I’ll bring him a bag of fine nuts, and the vinegar,

3	

3	3	for I have often seen him take some.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front door she

3	

3	3	took off the hinges, and said, ‘Frederick told me to lock the door, but

3	

3	3	surely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me.’ So she took

3	

3	3	her time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she cried

3	

3	3	out, ‘There, Frederick, there is the door itself, you may watch it as

3	

3	3	carefully as you please.’ ‘Alas! alas!’ said he, ‘what a clever wife I

3	

3	3	have! I sent you to make the house fast, and you take the door away, so

3	

3	3	that everybody may go in and out as they please--however, as you have

3	

3	3	brought the door, you shall carry it about with you for your pains.’

3	

3	3	‘Very well,’ answered she, ‘I’ll carry the door; but I’ll not carry the

3	

3	3	nuts and vinegar bottle also--that would be too much of a load; so if

3	

3	3	you please, I’ll fasten them to the door.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Frederick of course made no objection to that plan, and they set off

3	

3	3	into the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find them: and

3	

3	3	when it grew dark, they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there.

3	

3	3	Scarcely were they up, than who should come by but the very rogues they

3	

3	3	were looking for. They were in truth great rascals, and belonged to that

3	

3	3	class of people who find things before they are lost; they were tired;

3	

3	3	so they sat down and made a fire under the very tree where Frederick and

3	

3	3	Catherine were. Frederick slipped down on the other side, and picked up

3	

3	3	some stones. Then he climbed up again, and tried to hit the thieves on

3	

3	3	the head with them: but they only said, ‘It must be near morning, for

3	

3	3	the wind shakes the fir-apples down.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Catherine, who had the door on her shoulder, began to be very tired;

3	

3	3	but she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy: so she said

3	

3	3	softly, ‘Frederick, I must let the nuts go.’ ‘No,’ answered he, ‘not

3	

3	3	now, they will discover us.’ ‘I can’t help that: they must go.’ ‘Well,

3	

3	3	then, make haste and throw them down, if you will.’ Then away rattled

3	

3	3	the nuts down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried, ‘Bless me,

3	

3	3	it is hailing.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	A little while after, Catherine thought the door was still very heavy:

3	

3	3	so she whispered to Frederick, ‘I must throw the vinegar down.’ ‘Pray

3	

3	3	don’t,’ answered he, ‘it will discover us.’ ‘I can’t help that,’ said

3	

3	3	she, ‘go it must.’ So she poured all the vinegar down; and the thieves

3	

3	3	said, ‘What a heavy dew there is!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	At last it popped into Catherine’s head that it was the door itself that

3	

3	3	was so heavy all the time: so she whispered, ‘Frederick, I must throw

3	

3	3	the door down soon.’ But he begged and prayed her not to do so, for he

3	

3	3	was sure it would betray them. ‘Here goes, however,’ said she: and down

3	

3	3	went the door with such a clatter upon the thieves, that they cried

3	

3	3	out ‘Murder!’ and not knowing what was coming, ran away as fast as they

3	

3	3	could, and left all the gold. So when Frederick and Catherine came down,

3	

3	3	there they found all their money safe and sound.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	SWEETHEART ROLAND

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and had two

3	

3	3	daughters, one ugly and wicked, and this one she loved because she was

3	

3	3	her own daughter, and one beautiful and good, and this one she hated,

3	

3	3	because she was her stepdaughter. The stepdaughter once had a pretty

3	

3	3	apron, which the other fancied so much that she became envious, and

3	

3	3	told her mother that she must and would have that apron. ‘Be quiet, my

3	

3	3	child,’ said the old woman, ‘and you shall have it. Your stepsister has

3	

3	3	long deserved death; tonight when she is asleep I will come and cut her

3	

3	3	head off. Only be careful that you are at the far side of the bed, and

3	

3	3	push her well to the front.’ It would have been all over with the poor

3	

3	3	girl if she had not just then been standing in a corner, and heard

3	

3	3	everything. All day long she dared not go out of doors, and when bedtime

3	

3	3	had come, the witch’s daughter got into bed first, so as to lie at the

3	

3	3	far side, but when she was asleep, the other pushed her gently to the

3	

3	3	front, and took for herself the place at the back, close by the wall. In

3	

3	3	the night, the old woman came creeping in, she held an axe in her right

3	

3	3	hand, and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the outside,

3	

3	3	and then she grasped the axe with both hands, and cut her own child’s

3	

3	3	head off.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When she had gone away, the girl got up and went to her sweetheart, who

3	

3	3	was called Roland, and knocked at his door. When he came out, she said

3	

3	3	to him: ‘Listen, dearest Roland, we must fly in all haste; my stepmother

3	

3	3	wanted to kill me, but has struck her own child. When daylight comes,

3	

3	3	and she sees what she has done, we shall be lost.’ ‘But,’ said Roland,

3	

3	3	‘I counsel you first to take away her magic wand, or we cannot escape

3	

3	3	if she pursues us.’ The maiden fetched the magic wand, and she took the

3	

3	3	dead girl’s head and dropped three drops of blood on the ground, one in

3	

3	3	front of the bed, one in the kitchen, and one on the stairs. Then she

3	

3	3	hurried away with her lover.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When the old witch got up next morning, she called her daughter, and

3	

3	3	wanted to give her the apron, but she did not come. Then the witch

3	

3	3	cried: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Here, on the stairs, I am sweeping,’ answered

3	

3	3	the first drop of blood. The old woman went out, but saw no one on the

3	

3	3	stairs, and cried again: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Here in the kitchen, I am

3	

3	3	warming myself,’ cried the second drop of blood. She went into the

3	

3	3	kitchen, but found no one. Then she cried again: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Ah,

3	

3	3	here in the bed, I am sleeping,’ cried the third drop of blood. She went

3	

3	3	into the room to the bed. What did she see there? Her own child,

3	

3	3	whose head she had cut off, bathed in her blood. The witch fell into

3	

3	3	a passion, sprang to the window, and as she could look forth quite far

3	

3	3	into the world, she perceived her stepdaughter hurrying away with her

3	

3	3	sweetheart Roland. ‘That shall not help you,’ cried she, ‘even if you

3	

3	3	have got a long way off, you shall still not escape me.’ She put on her

3	

3	3	many-league boots, in which she covered an hour’s walk at every step,

3	

3	3	and it was not long before she overtook them. The girl, however, when

3	

3	3	she saw the old woman striding towards her, changed, with her magic

3	

3	3	wand, her sweetheart Roland into a lake, and herself into a duck

3	

3	3	swimming in the middle of it. The witch placed herself on the shore,

3	

3	3	threw breadcrumbs in, and went to endless trouble to entice the duck;

3	

3	3	but the duck did not let herself be enticed, and the old woman had to

3	

3	3	go home at night as she had come. At this the girl and her sweetheart

3	

3	3	Roland resumed their natural shapes again, and they walked on the whole

3	

3	3	night until daybreak. Then the maiden changed herself into a beautiful

3	

3	3	flower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge, and her sweetheart

3	

3	3	Roland into a fiddler. It was not long before the witch came striding up

3	

3	3	towards them, and said to the musician: ‘Dear musician, may I pluck that

3	

3	3	beautiful flower for myself?’ ‘Oh, yes,’ he replied, ‘I will play to

3	

3	3	you while you do it.’ As she was hastily creeping into the hedge and was

3	

3	3	just going to pluck the flower, knowing perfectly well who the flower

3	

3	3	was, he began to play, and whether she would or not, she was forced

3	

3	3	to dance, for it was a magical dance. The faster he played, the more

3	

3	3	violent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes

3	

3	3	from her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he

3	

3	3	did not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	As they were now set free, Roland said: ‘Now I will go to my father and

3	

3	3	arrange for the wedding.’ ‘Then in the meantime I will stay here and

3	

3	3	wait for you,’ said the girl, ‘and that no one may recognize me, I will

3	

3	3	change myself into a red stone landmark.’ Then Roland went away, and the

3	

3	3	girl stood like a red landmark in the field and waited for her beloved.

3	

3	3	But when Roland got home, he fell into the snares of another, who so

3	

3	3	fascinated him that he forgot the maiden. The poor girl remained there a

3	

3	3	long time, but at length, as he did not return at all, she was sad, and

3	

3	3	changed herself into a flower, and thought: ‘Someone will surely come

3	

3	3	this way, and trample me down.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	It befell, however, that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field and saw

3	

3	3	the flower, and as it was so pretty, plucked it, took it with him, and

3	

3	3	laid it away in his chest. From that time forth, strange things happened

3	

3	3	in the shepherd’s house. When he arose in the morning, all the work was

3	

3	3	already done, the room was swept, the table and benches cleaned, the

3	

3	3	fire in the hearth was lighted, and the water was fetched, and at noon,

3	

3	3	when he came home, the table was laid, and a good dinner served. He

3	

3	3	could not conceive how this came to pass, for he never saw a human being

3	

3	3	in his house, and no one could have concealed himself in it. He was

3	

3	3	certainly pleased with this good attendance, but still at last he was so

3	

3	3	afraid that he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice. The wise

3	

3	3	woman said: ‘There is some enchantment behind it, listen very early some

3	

3	3	morning if anything is moving in the room, and if you see anything, no

3	

3	3	matter what it is, throw a white cloth over it, and then the magic will

3	

3	3	be stopped.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The shepherd did as she bade him, and next morning just as day dawned,

3	

3	3	he saw the chest open, and the flower come out. Swiftly he

3	

3	3	sprang towards it, and threw a white cloth over it. Instantly the

3	

3	3	transformation came to an end, and a beautiful girl stood before him,

3	

3	3	who admitted to him that she had been the flower, and that up to this

3	

3	3	time she had attended to his house-keeping. She told him her story,

3	

3	3	and as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him, but she

3	

3	3	answered: ‘No,’ for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart

3	

3	3	Roland, although he had deserted her. Nevertheless, she promised not to

3	

3	3	go away, but to continue keeping house for the shepherd.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And now the time drew near when Roland’s wedding was to be celebrated,

3	

3	3	and then, according to an old custom in the country, it was announced

3	

3	3	that all the girls were to be present at it, and sing in honour of the

3	

3	3	bridal pair. When the faithful maiden heard of this, she grew so sad

3	

3	3	that she thought her heart would break, and she would not go thither,

3	

3	3	but the other girls came and took her. When it came to her turn to sing,

3	

3	3	she stepped back, until at last she was the only one left, and then she

3	

3	3	could not refuse. But when she began her song, and it reached Roland’s

3	

3	3	ears, he sprang up and cried: ‘I know the voice, that is the true

3	

3	3	bride, I will have no other!’ Everything he had forgotten, and which had

3	

3	3	vanished from his mind, had suddenly come home again to his heart. Then

3	

3	3	the faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart Roland, and

3	

3	3	grief came to an end and joy began.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	SNOWDROP

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	It was the middle of winter, when the broad flakes of snow were falling

3	

3	3	around, that the queen of a country many thousand miles off sat working

3	

3	3	at her window. The frame of the window was made of fine black ebony, and

3	

3	3	as she sat looking out upon the snow, she pricked her finger, and three

3	

3	3	drops of blood fell upon it. Then she gazed thoughtfully upon the red

3	

3	3	drops that sprinkled the white snow, and said, ‘Would that my little

3	

3	3	daughter may be as white as that snow, as red as that blood, and as

3	

3	3	black as this ebony windowframe!’ And so the little girl really did grow

3	

3	3	up; her skin was as white as snow, her cheeks as rosy as the blood, and

3	

3	3	her hair as black as ebony; and she was called Snowdrop.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But this queen died; and the king soon married another wife, who became

3	

3	3	queen, and was very beautiful, but so vain that she could not bear

3	

3	3	to think that anyone could be handsomer than she was. She had a fairy

3	

3	3	looking-glass, to which she used to go, and then she would gaze upon

3	

3	3	herself in it, and say:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Tell me, glass, tell me true!

3	

3	3	  Of all the ladies in the land,

3	

3	3	  Who is fairest, tell me, who?’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And the glass had always answered:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all the land.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But Snowdrop grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years

3	

3	3	old she was as bright as the day, and fairer than the queen herself.

3	

3	3	Then the glass one day answered the queen, when she went to look in it

3	

3	3	as usual:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Thou, queen, art fair, and beauteous to see,

3	

3	3	  But Snowdrop is lovelier far than thee!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy, and called to

3	

3	3	one of her servants, and said, ‘Take Snowdrop away into the wide wood,

3	

3	3	that I may never see her any more.’ Then the servant led her away; but

3	

3	3	his heart melted when Snowdrop begged him to spare her life, and he

3	

3	3	said, ‘I will not hurt you, thou pretty child.’ So he left her by

3	

3	3	herself; and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts would

3	

3	3	tear her in pieces, he felt as if a great weight were taken off his

3	

3	3	heart when he had made up his mind not to kill her but to leave her to

3	

3	3	her fate, with the chance of someone finding and saving her.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then poor Snowdrop wandered along through the wood in great fear; and

3	

3	3	the wild beasts roared about her, but none did her any harm. In the

3	

3	3	evening she came to a cottage among the hills, and went in to rest, for

3	

3	3	her little feet would carry her no further. Everything was spruce and

3	

3	3	neat in the cottage: on the table was spread a white cloth, and there

3	

3	3	were seven little plates, seven little loaves, and seven little glasses

3	

3	3	with wine in them; and seven knives and forks laid in order; and by

3	

3	3	the wall stood seven little beds. As she was very hungry, she picked

3	

3	3	a little piece of each loaf and drank a very little wine out of each

3	

3	3	glass; and after that she thought she would lie down and rest. So she

3	

3	3	tried all the little beds; but one was too long, and another was too

3	

3	3	short, till at last the seventh suited her: and there she laid herself

3	

3	3	down and went to sleep.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	By and by in came the masters of the cottage. Now they were seven little

3	

3	3	dwarfs, that lived among the mountains, and dug and searched for gold.

3	

3	3	They lighted up their seven lamps, and saw at once that all was not

3	

3	3	right. The first said, ‘Who has been sitting on my stool?’ The second,

3	

3	3	‘Who has been eating off my plate?’ The third, ‘Who has been picking my

3	

3	3	bread?’ The fourth, ‘Who has been meddling with my spoon?’ The fifth,

3	

3	3	‘Who has been handling my fork?’ The sixth, ‘Who has been cutting with

3	

3	3	my knife?’ The seventh, ‘Who has been drinking my wine?’ Then the first

3	

3	3	looked round and said, ‘Who has been lying on my bed?’ And the rest came

3	

3	3	running to him, and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his

3	

3	3	bed. But the seventh saw Snowdrop, and called all his brethren to come

3	

3	3	and see her; and they cried out with wonder and astonishment and brought

3	

3	3	their lamps to look at her, and said, ‘Good heavens! what a lovely child

3	

3	3	she is!’ And they were very glad to see her, and took care not to wake

3	

3	3	her; and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs

3	

3	3	in turn, till the night was gone.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	In the morning Snowdrop told them all her story; and they pitied her,

3	

3	3	and said if she would keep all things in order, and cook and wash and

3	

3	3	knit and spin for them, she might stay where she was, and they would

3	

3	3	take good care of her. Then they went out all day long to their work,

3	

3	3	seeking for gold and silver in the mountains: but Snowdrop was left at

3	

3	3	home; and they warned her, and said, ‘The queen will soon find out where

3	

3	3	you are, so take care and let no one in.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But the queen, now that she thought Snowdrop was dead, believed that she

3	

3	3	must be the handsomest lady in the land; and she went to her glass and

3	

3	3	said:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Tell me, glass, tell me true!

3	

3	3	  Of all the ladies in the land,

3	

3	3	  Who is fairest, tell me, who?’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And the glass answered:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:

3	

3	3	  But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,

3	

3	3	  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,

3	

3	3	  There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she

3	

3	3	  Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the queen was very much frightened; for she knew that the glass

3	

3	3	always spoke the truth, and was sure that the servant had betrayed her.

3	

3	3	And she could not bear to think that anyone lived who was more beautiful

3	

3	3	than she was; so she dressed herself up as an old pedlar, and went

3	

3	3	her way over the hills, to the place where the dwarfs dwelt. Then she

3	

3	3	knocked at the door, and cried, ‘Fine wares to sell!’ Snowdrop looked

3	

3	3	out at the window, and said, ‘Good day, good woman! what have you to

3	

3	3	sell?’ ‘Good wares, fine wares,’ said she; ‘laces and bobbins of all

3	

3	3	colours.’ ‘I will let the old lady in; she seems to be a very good

3	

3	3	sort of body,’ thought Snowdrop, as she ran down and unbolted the door.

3	

3	3	‘Bless me!’ said the old woman, ‘how badly your stays are laced! Let me

3	

3	3	lace them up with one of my nice new laces.’ Snowdrop did not dream of

3	

3	3	any mischief; so she stood before the old woman; but she set to work

3	

3	3	so nimbly, and pulled the lace so tight, that Snowdrop’s breath was

3	

3	3	stopped, and she fell down as if she were dead. ‘There’s an end to all

3	

3	3	thy beauty,’ said the spiteful queen, and went away home.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	In the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and I need not say how

3	

3	3	grieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon the

3	

3	3	ground, as if she was quite dead. However, they lifted her up, and when

3	

3	3	they found what ailed her, they cut the lace; and in a little time she

3	

3	3	began to breathe, and very soon came to life again. Then they said, ‘The

3	

3	3	old woman was the queen herself; take care another time, and let no one

3	

3	3	in when we are away.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When the queen got home, she went straight to her glass, and spoke to it

3	

3	3	as before; but to her great grief it still said:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:

3	

3	3	  But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,

3	

3	3	  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,

3	

3	3	  There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she

3	

3	3	  Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see that

3	

3	3	Snowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in quite

3	

3	3	another dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned

3	

3	3	comb. When she reached the dwarfs’ cottage, she knocked at the door, and

3	

3	3	cried, ‘Fine wares to sell!’ But Snowdrop said, ‘I dare not let anyone

3	

3	3	in.’ Then the queen said, ‘Only look at my beautiful combs!’ and gave

3	

3	3	her the poisoned one. And it looked so pretty, that she took it up and

3	

3	3	put it into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head,

3	

3	3	the poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless. ‘There you may

3	

3	3	lie,’ said the queen, and went her way. But by good luck the dwarfs

3	

3	3	came in very early that evening; and when they saw Snowdrop lying on

3	

3	3	the ground, they thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned

3	

3	3	comb. And when they took it away she got well, and told them all that

3	

3	3	had passed; and they warned her once more not to open the door to

3	

3	3	anyone.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Meantime the queen went home to her glass, and shook with rage when she

3	

3	3	read the very same answer as before; and she said, ‘Snowdrop shall die,

3	

3	3	if it cost me my life.’ So she went by herself into her chamber, and got

3	

3	3	ready a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but

3	

3	3	whoever tasted it was sure to die. Then she dressed herself up as a

3	

3	3	peasant’s wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs’ cottage,

3	

3	3	and knocked at the door; but Snowdrop put her head out of the window and

3	

3	3	said, ‘I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not.’ ‘Do

3	

3	3	as you please,’ said the old woman, ‘but at any rate take this pretty

3	

3	3	apple; I will give it you.’ ‘No,’ said Snowdrop, ‘I dare not take it.’

3	

3	3	‘You silly girl!’ answered the other, ‘what are you afraid of? Do you

3	

3	3	think it is poisoned? Come! do you eat one part, and I will eat the

3	

3	3	other.’ Now the apple was so made up that one side was good, though the

3	

3	3	other side was poisoned. Then Snowdrop was much tempted to taste, for

3	

3	3	the apple looked so very nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she

3	

3	3	could wait no longer. But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth,

3	

3	3	when she fell down dead upon the ground. ‘This time nothing will save

3	

3	3	thee,’ said the queen; and she went home to her glass, and at last it

3	

3	3	said:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest of all the fair.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And then her wicked heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could

3	

3	3	be.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When evening came, and the dwarfs had gone home, they found Snowdrop

3	

3	3	lying on the ground: no breath came from her lips, and they were afraid

3	

3	3	that she was quite dead. They lifted her up, and combed her hair, and

3	

3	3	washed her face with wine and water; but all was in vain, for the little

3	

3	3	girl seemed quite dead. So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven

3	

3	3	watched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they

3	

3	3	would bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just

3	

3	3	as it did while she was alive; so they said, ‘We will never bury her in

3	

3	3	the cold ground.’ And they made a coffin of glass, so that they might

3	

3	3	still look at her, and wrote upon it in golden letters what her name

3	

3	3	was, and that she was a king’s daughter. And the coffin was set among

3	

3	3	the hills, and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched. And the

3	

3	3	birds of the air came too, and bemoaned Snowdrop; and first of all came

3	

3	3	an owl, and then a raven, and at last a dove, and sat by her side.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And thus Snowdrop lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as

3	

3	3	though she was asleep; for she was even now as white as snow, and as red

3	

3	3	as blood, and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and called at the

3	

3	3	dwarfs’ house; and he saw Snowdrop, and read what was written in golden

3	

3	3	letters. Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and besought them

3	

3	3	to let him take her away; but they said, ‘We will not part with her for

3	

3	3	all the gold in the world.’ At last, however, they had pity on him, and

3	

3	3	gave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home

3	

3	3	with him, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and Snowdrop

3	

3	3	awoke, and said, ‘Where am I?’ And the prince said, ‘Thou art quite safe

3	

3	3	with me.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then he told her all that had happened, and said, ‘I love you far better

3	

3	3	than all the world; so come with me to my father’s palace, and you shall

3	

3	3	be my wife.’ And Snowdrop consented, and went home with the prince;

3	

3	3	and everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for their

3	

3	3	wedding.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	To the feast was asked, among the rest, Snowdrop’s old enemy the queen;

3	

3	3	and as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes, she looked in the

3	

3	3	glass and said:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Tell me, glass, tell me true!

3	

3	3	  Of all the ladies in the land,

3	

3	3	  Who is fairest, tell me, who?’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And the glass answered:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Thou, lady, art loveliest here, I ween;

3	

3	3	  But lovelier far is the new-made queen.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When she heard this she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity

3	

3	3	were so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride. And

3	

3	3	when she got there, and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop, who, as

3	

3	3	she thought, had been dead a long while, she choked with rage, and fell

3	

3	3	down and died: but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happily

3	

3	3	over that land many, many years; and sometimes they went up into the

3	

3	3	mountains, and paid a visit to the little dwarfs, who had been so kind

3	

3	3	to Snowdrop in her time of need.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	THE PINK

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There was once upon a time a queen to whom God had given no children.

3	

3	3	Every morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven to

3	

3	3	bestow on her a son or a daughter. Then an angel from heaven came to her

3	

3	3	and said: ‘Be at rest, you shall have a son with the power of wishing,

3	

3	3	so that whatsoever in the world he wishes for, that shall he have.’ Then

3	

3	3	she went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings, and when the time

3	

3	3	was come she gave birth to a son, and the king was filled with gladness.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Every morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild

3	

3	3	beasts were kept, and washed herself there in a clear stream. It

3	

3	3	happened once when the child was a little older, that it was lying in

3	

3	3	her arms and she fell asleep. Then came the old cook, who knew that the

3	

3	3	child had the power of wishing, and stole it away, and he took a hen,

3	

3	3	and cut it in pieces, and dropped some of its blood on the queen’s apron

3	

3	3	and on her dress. Then he carried the child away to a secret place,

3	

3	3	where a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to the king and

3	

3	3	accused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by

3	

3	3	the wild beasts. When the king saw the blood on her apron, he believed

3	

3	3	this, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built,

3	

3	3	in which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had his wife put into

3	

3	3	it, and walled up. Here she was to stay for seven years without meat

3	

3	3	or drink, and die of hunger. But God sent two angels from heaven in the

3	

3	3	shape of white doves, which flew to her twice a day, and carried her

3	

3	3	food until the seven years were over.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The cook, however, thought to himself: ‘If the child has the power of

3	

3	3	wishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble.’ So

3	

3	3	he left the palace and went to the boy, who was already big enough to

3	

3	3	speak, and said to him: ‘Wish for a beautiful palace for yourself with

3	

3	3	a garden, and all else that pertains to it.’ Scarcely were the words out

3	

3	3	of the boy’s mouth, when everything was there that he had wished for.

3	

3	3	After a while the cook said to him: ‘It is not well for you to be so

3	

3	3	alone, wish for a pretty girl as a companion.’ Then the king’s son

3	

3	3	wished for one, and she immediately stood before him, and was more

3	

3	3	beautiful than any painter could have painted her. The two played

3	

3	3	together, and loved each other with all their hearts, and the old cook

3	

3	3	went out hunting like a nobleman. The thought occurred to him, however,

3	

3	3	that the king’s son might some day wish to be with his father, and thus

3	

3	3	bring him into great peril. So he went out and took the maiden aside,

3	

3	3	and said: ‘Tonight when the boy is asleep, go to his bed and plunge this

3	

3	3	knife into his heart, and bring me his heart and tongue, and if you do

3	

3	3	not do it, you shall lose your life.’ Thereupon he went away, and when

3	

3	3	he returned next day she had not done it, and said: ‘Why should I shed

3	

3	3	the blood of an innocent boy who has never harmed anyone?’ The cook once

3	

3	3	more said: ‘If you do not do it, it shall cost you your own life.’ When

3	

3	3	he had gone away, she had a little hind brought to her, and ordered her

3	

3	3	to be killed, and took her heart and tongue, and laid them on a plate,

3	

3	3	and when she saw the old man coming, she said to the boy: ‘Lie down in

3	

3	3	your bed, and draw the clothes over you.’ Then the wicked wretch came in

3	

3	3	and said: ‘Where are the boy’s heart and tongue?’ The girl reached the

3	

3	3	plate to him, but the king’s son threw off the quilt, and said: ‘You old

3	

3	3	sinner, why did you want to kill me? Now will I pronounce thy sentence.

3	

3	3	You shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neck,

3	

3	3	and shall eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from your

3	

3	3	throat.’ And when he had spoken these words, the old man was changed

3	

3	3	into a poodle dog, and had a gold collar round his neck, and the cooks

3	

3	3	were ordered to bring up some live coals, and these he ate, until the

3	

3	3	flames broke forth from his throat. The king’s son remained there a

3	

3	3	short while longer, and he thought of his mother, and wondered if she

3	

3	3	were still alive. At length he said to the maiden: ‘I will go home to my

3	

3	3	own country; if you will go with me, I will provide for you.’ ‘Ah,’

3	

3	3	she replied, ‘the way is so long, and what shall I do in a strange land

3	

3	3	where I am unknown?’ As she did not seem quite willing, and as they

3	

3	3	could not be parted from each other, he wished that she might be changed

3	

3	3	into a beautiful pink, and took her with him. Then he went away to his

3	

3	3	own country, and the poodle had to run after him. He went to the tower

3	

3	3	in which his mother was confined, and as it was so high, he wished for

3	

3	3	a ladder which would reach up to the very top. Then he mounted up and

3	

3	3	looked inside, and cried: ‘Beloved mother, Lady Queen, are you still

3	

3	3	alive, or are you dead?’ She answered: ‘I have just eaten, and am still

3	

3	3	satisfied,’ for she thought the angels were there. Said he: ‘I am your

3	

3	3	dear son, whom the wild beasts were said to have torn from your arms;

3	

3	3	but I am alive still, and will soon set you free.’ Then he descended

3	

3	3	again, and went to his father, and caused himself to be announced as a

3	

3	3	strange huntsman, and asked if he could offer him service. The king said

3	

3	3	yes, if he was skilful and could get game for him, he should come to

3	

3	3	him, but that deer had never taken up their quarters in any part of the

3	

3	3	district or country. Then the huntsman promised to procure as much game

3	

3	3	for him as he could possibly use at the royal table. So he summoned all

3	

3	3	the huntsmen together, and bade them go out into the forest with him.

3	

3	3	And he went with them and made them form a great circle, open at one end

3	

3	3	where he stationed himself, and began to wish. Two hundred deer and more

3	

3	3	came running inside the circle at once, and the huntsmen shot them.

3	

3	3	Then they were all placed on sixty country carts, and driven home to the

3	

3	3	king, and for once he was able to deck his table with game, after having

3	

3	3	had none at all for years.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Now the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire

3	

3	3	household should eat with him next day, and made a great feast. When

3	

3	3	they were all assembled together, he said to the huntsman: ‘As you are

3	

3	3	so clever, you shall sit by me.’ He replied: ‘Lord King, your majesty

3	

3	3	must excuse me, I am a poor huntsman.’ But the king insisted on it,

3	

3	3	and said: ‘You shall sit by me,’ until he did it. Whilst he was sitting

3	

3	3	there, he thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one of the

3	

3	3	king’s principal servants would begin to speak of her, and would ask how

3	

3	3	it was faring with the queen in the tower, and if she were alive still,

3	

3	3	or had perished. Hardly had he formed the wish than the marshal began,

3	

3	3	and said: ‘Your majesty, we live joyously here, but how is the queen

3	

3	3	living in the tower? Is she still alive, or has she died?’ But the king

3	

3	3	replied: ‘She let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts; I will

3	

3	3	not have her named.’ Then the huntsman arose and said: ‘Gracious lord

3	

3	3	father she is alive still, and I am her son, and I was not carried away

3	

3	3	by wild beasts, but by that wretch the old cook, who tore me from her

3	

3	3	arms when she was asleep, and sprinkled her apron with the blood of a

3	

3	3	chicken.’ Thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar, and said:

3	

3	3	‘That is the wretch!’ and caused live coals to be brought, and these the

3	

3	3	dog was compelled to devour before the sight of all, until flames burst

3	

3	3	forth from its throat. On this the huntsman asked the king if he would

3	

3	3	like to see the dog in his true shape, and wished him back into the form

3	

3	3	of the cook, in the which he stood immediately, with his white apron,

3	

3	3	and his knife by his side. When the king saw him he fell into a passion,

3	

3	3	and ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon. Then the huntsman

3	

3	3	spoke further and said: ‘Father, will you see the maiden who brought me

3	

3	3	up so tenderly and who was afterwards to murder me, but did not do it,

3	

3	3	though her own life depended on it?’ The king replied: ‘Yes, I would

3	

3	3	like to see her.’ The son said: ‘Most gracious father, I will show her

3	

3	3	to you in the form of a beautiful flower,’ and he thrust his hand into

3	

3	3	his pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table,

3	

3	3	and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.

3	

3	3	Then the son said: ‘Now will I show her to you in her own form,’ and

3	

3	3	wished that she might become a maiden, and she stood there looking so

3	

3	3	beautiful that no painter could have made her look more so.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And the king sent two waiting-maids and two attendants into the tower,

3	

3	3	to fetch the queen and bring her to the royal table. But when she was

3	

3	3	led in she ate nothing, and said: ‘The gracious and merciful God who has

3	

3	3	supported me in the tower, will soon set me free.’ She lived three days

3	

3	3	more, and then died happily, and when she was buried, the two white

3	

3	3	doves which had brought her food to the tower, and were angels of

3	

3	3	heaven, followed her body and seated themselves on her grave. The aged

3	

3	3	king ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces, but grief consumed the

3	

3	3	king’s own heart, and he soon died. His son married the beautiful maiden

3	

3	3	whom he had brought with him as a flower in his pocket, and whether they

3	

3	3	are still alive or not, is known to God.

3	

3	3	CLEVER ELSIE

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie. And

3	

3	3	when she had grown up her father said: ‘We will get her married.’ ‘Yes,’

3	

3	3	said the mother, ‘if only someone would come who would have her.’ At

3	

3	3	length a man came from a distance and wooed her, who was called Hans;

3	

3	3	but he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really smart. ‘Oh,’ said

3	

3	3	the father, ‘she has plenty of good sense’; and the mother said: ‘Oh,

3	

3	3	she can see the wind coming up the street, and hear the flies coughing.’

3	

3	3	‘Well,’ said Hans, ‘if she is not really smart, I won’t have her.’ When

3	

3	3	they were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said: ‘Elsie, go

3	

3	3	into the cellar and fetch some beer.’ Then Clever Elsie took the pitcher

3	

3	3	from the wall, went into the cellar, and tapped the lid briskly as she

3	

3	3	went, so that the time might not appear long. When she was below she

3	

3	3	fetched herself a chair, and set it before the barrel so that she had

3	

3	3	no need to stoop, and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected

3	

3	3	injury. Then she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and

3	

3	3	while the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle, but

3	

3	3	looked up at the wall, and after much peering here and there, saw a

3	

3	3	pick-axe exactly above her, which the masons had accidentally left

3	

3	3	there.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then Clever Elsie began to weep and said: ‘If I get Hans, and we have

3	

3	3	a child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to draw

3	

3	3	beer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then she

3	

3	3	sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the

3	

3	3	misfortune which lay before her. Those upstairs waited for the drink,

3	

3	3	but Clever Elsie still did not come. Then the woman said to the servant:

3	

3	3	‘Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is.’ The maid went and

3	

3	3	found her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly. ‘Elsie why

3	

3	3	do you weep?’ asked the maid. ‘Ah,’ she answered, ‘have I not reason to

3	

3	3	weep? If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to

3	

3	3	draw beer here, the pick-axe will perhaps fall on his head, and kill

3	

3	3	him.’ Then said the maid: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down

3	

3	3	beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune. After a while,

3	

3	3	as the maid did not come back, and those upstairs were thirsty for the

3	

3	3	beer, the man said to the boy: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see

3	

3	3	where Elsie and the girl are.’ The boy went down, and there sat Clever

3	

3	3	Elsie and the girl both weeping together. Then he asked: ‘Why are you

3	

3	3	weeping?’ ‘Ah,’ said Elsie, ‘have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans,

3	

3	3	and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the

3	

3	3	pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then said the boy: ‘What

3	

3	3	a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down by her, and likewise began to

3	

3	3	howl loudly. Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he still did not

3	

3	3	return, the man said to the woman: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see

3	

3	3	where Elsie is!’ The woman went down, and found all three in the midst

3	

3	3	of their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then Elsie told

3	

3	3	her also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it

3	

3	3	grew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down. Then said the

3	

3	3	mother likewise: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down and wept

3	

3	3	with them. The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not

3	

3	3	come back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said: ‘I must go into the

3	

3	3	cellar myself and see where Elsie is.’ But when he got into the cellar,

3	

3	3	and they were all sitting together crying, and he heard the reason, and

3	

3	3	that Elsie’s child was the cause, and the Elsie might perhaps bring one

3	

3	3	into the world some day, and that he might be killed by the pick-axe, if

3	

3	3	he should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very

3	

3	3	time when it fell down, he cried: ‘Oh, what a clever Elsie!’ and sat

3	

3	3	down, and likewise wept with them. The bridegroom stayed upstairs alone

3	

3	3	for a long time; then as no one would come back he thought: ‘They must be

3	

3	3	waiting for me below: I too must go there and see what they are about.’

3	

3	3	When he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting

3	

3	3	quite piteously, each out-doing the other. ‘What misfortune has happened

3	

3	3	then?’ asked he. ‘Ah, dear Hans,’ said Elsie, ‘if we marry each other

3	

3	3	and have a child, and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw

3	

3	3	something to drink, then the pick-axe which has been left up there might

3	

3	3	dash his brains out if it were to fall down, so have we not reason to

3	

3	3	weep?’ ‘Come,’ said Hans, ‘more understanding than that is not needed

3	

3	3	for my household, as you are such a clever Elsie, I will have you,’ and

3	

3	3	seized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	After Hans had had her some time, he said: ‘Wife, I am going out to work

3	

3	3	and earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the corn that we

3	

3	3	may have some bread.’ ‘Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.’ After Hans had

3	

3	3	gone away, she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field

3	

3	3	with her. When she came to the field she said to herself: ‘What shall I

3	

3	3	do; shall I cut first, or shall I eat first? Oh, I will eat first.’ Then

3	

3	3	she drank her cup of broth and when she was fully satisfied, she once

3	

3	3	more said: ‘What shall I do? Shall I cut first, or shall I sleep first?

3	

3	3	I will sleep first.’ Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep.

3	

3	3	Hans had been at home for a long time, but Elsie did not come; then said

3	

3	3	he: ‘What a clever Elsie I have; she is so industrious that she does not

3	

3	3	even come home to eat.’ But when evening came and she still stayed away,

3	

3	3	Hans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she

3	

3	3	was lying among the corn asleep. Then Hans hastened home and brought

3	

3	3	a fowler’s net with little bells and hung it round about her, and she

3	

3	3	still went on sleeping. Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat

3	

3	3	down in his chair and worked. At length, when it was quite dark, Clever

3	

3	3	Elsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about

3	

3	3	her, and the bells rang at each step which she took. Then she was

3	

3	3	alarmed, and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie or

3	

3	3	not, and said: ‘Is it I, or is it not I?’ But she knew not what answer

3	

3	3	to make to this, and stood for a time in doubt; at length she thought:

3	

3	3	‘I will go home and ask if it be I, or if it be not I, they will be sure

3	

3	3	to know.’ She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut; then

3	

3	3	she knocked at the window and cried: ‘Hans, is Elsie within?’ ‘Yes,’

3	

3	3	answered Hans, ‘she is within.’ Hereupon she was terrified, and said:

3	

3	3	‘Ah, heavens! Then it is not I,’ and went to another door; but when the

3	

3	3	people heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it, and she

3	

3	3	could get in nowhere. Then she ran out of the village, and no one has

3	

3	3	seen her since.

3	

3	3	THE MISER IN THE BUSH

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	A farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard for

3	

3	3	him three years, without having been paid any wages. At last it came

3	

3	3	into the man’s head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer;

3	

3	3	so he went to his master, and said, ‘I have worked hard for you a long

3	

3	3	time, I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for my

3	

3	3	trouble.’ The farmer was a sad miser, and knew that his man was very

3	

3	3	simple-hearted; so he took out threepence, and gave him for every year’s

3	

3	3	service a penny. The poor fellow thought it was a great deal of money to

3	

3	3	have, and said to himself, ‘Why should I work hard, and live here on bad

3	

3	3	fare any longer? I can now travel into the wide world, and make myself

3	

3	3	merry.’ With that he put his money into his purse, and set out, roaming

3	

3	3	over hill and valley.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	As he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little dwarf

3	

3	3	met him, and asked him what made him so merry. ‘Why, what should make

3	

3	3	me down-hearted?’ said he; ‘I am sound in health and rich in purse, what

3	

3	3	should I care for? I have saved up my three years’ earnings and have it

3	

3	3	all safe in my pocket.’ ‘How much may it come to?’ said the little man.

3	

3	3	‘Full threepence,’ replied the countryman. ‘I wish you would give them

3	

3	3	to me,’ said the other; ‘I am very poor.’ Then the man pitied him, and

3	

3	3	gave him all he had; and the little dwarf said in return, ‘As you have

3	

3	3	such a kind honest heart, I will grant you three wishes--one for every

3	

3	3	penny; so choose whatever you like.’ Then the countryman rejoiced at

3	

3	3	his good luck, and said, ‘I like many things better than money: first, I

3	

3	3	will have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly,

3	

3	3	a fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and

3	

3	3	thirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask.’ The dwarf

3	

3	3	said he should have his three wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle,

3	

3	3	and went his way.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Our honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before,

3	

3	3	he was now ten times more so. He had not gone far before he met an old

3	

3	3	miser: close by them stood a tree, and on the topmost twig sat a thrush

3	

3	3	singing away most joyfully. ‘Oh, what a pretty bird!’ said the miser; ‘I

3	

3	3	would give a great deal of money to have such a one.’ ‘If that’s all,’

3	

3	3	said the countryman, ‘I will soon bring it down.’ Then he took up his

3	

3	3	bow, and down fell the thrush into the bushes at the foot of the tree.

3	

3	3	The miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into

3	

3	3	the middle, his companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the

3	

3	3	miser began to dance and spring about, capering higher and higher in

3	

3	3	the air. The thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hung

3	

3	3	in rags about him, and he himself was all scratched and wounded, so that

3	

3	3	the blood ran down. ‘Oh, for heaven’s sake!’ cried the miser, ‘Master!

3	

3	3	master! pray let the fiddle alone. What have I done to deserve this?’

3	

3	3	‘Thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough,’ said the other; ‘thou

3	

3	3	art only meeting thy reward’: so he played up another tune. Then the

3	

3	3	miser began to beg and promise, and offered money for his liberty; but

3	

3	3	he did not come up to the musician’s price for some time, and he danced

3	

3	3	him along brisker and brisker, and the miser bid higher and higher, till

3	

3	3	at last he offered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purse,

3	

3	3	and had just gained by cheating some poor fellow. When the countryman

3	

3	3	saw so much money, he said, ‘I will agree to your proposal.’ So he took

3	

3	3	the purse, put up his fiddle, and travelled on very pleased with his

3	

3	3	bargain.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous

3	

3	3	plight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve

3	

3	3	his late companion some trick. At last he went to the judge, and

3	

3	3	complained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him

3	

3	3	into the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his

3	

3	3	back and a fiddle hung round his neck. Then the judge sent out his

3	

3	3	officers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him; and he

3	

3	3	was soon caught and brought up to be tried.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of

3	

3	3	his money. ‘No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you.’ said the

3	

3	3	countryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the

3	

3	3	matter short by ordering him off to the gallows.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	So away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said, ‘My Lord

3	

3	3	Judge, grant me one last request.’ ‘Anything but thy life,’ replied the

3	

3	3	other. ‘No,’ said he, ‘I do not ask my life; only to let me play upon

3	

3	3	my fiddle for the last time.’ The miser cried out, ‘Oh, no! no! for

3	

3	3	heaven’s sake don’t listen to him! don’t listen to him!’ But the judge

3	

3	3	said, ‘It is only this once, he will soon have done.’ The fact was, he

3	

3	3	could not refuse the request, on account of the dwarf’s third gift.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the miser said, ‘Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity’s sake.’ But

3	

3	3	the countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the first

3	

3	3	note judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began capering, and

3	

3	3	no one could hold the miser. At the second note the hangman let his

3	

3	3	prisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first

3	

3	3	bar of the tune, all were dancing together--judge, court, and miser, and

3	

3	3	all the people who had followed to look on. At first the thing was merry

3	

3	3	and pleasant enough; but when it had gone on a while, and there seemed

3	

3	3	to be no end of playing or dancing, they began to cry out, and beg him

3	

3	3	to leave off; but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreaties,

3	

3	3	till the judge not only gave him his life, but promised to return him

3	

3	3	the hundred florins.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then he called to the miser, and said, ‘Tell us now, you vagabond, where

3	

3	3	you got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only,’ ‘I stole

3	

3	3	it,’ said the miser in the presence of all the people; ‘I acknowledge

3	

3	3	that I stole it, and that you earned it fairly.’ Then the countryman

3	

3	3	stopped his fiddle, and left the miser to take his place at the gallows.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	ASHPUTTEL

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The wife of a rich man fell sick; and when she felt that her end drew

3	

3	3	nigh, she called her only daughter to her bed-side, and said, ‘Always be

3	

3	3	a good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch over you.’ Soon

3	

3	3	afterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the garden;

3	

3	3	and the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and was always

3	

3	3	good and kind to all about her. And the snow fell and spread a beautiful

3	

3	3	white covering over the grave; but by the time the spring came, and the

3	

3	3	sun had melted it away again, her father had married another wife. This

3	

3	3	new wife had two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her;

3	

3	3	they were fair in face but foul at heart, and it was now a sorry time

3	

3	3	for the poor little girl. ‘What does the good-for-nothing want in the

3	

3	3	parlour?’ said they; ‘they who would eat bread should first earn it;

3	

3	3	away with the kitchen-maid!’ Then they took away her fine clothes, and

3	

3	3	gave her an old grey frock to put on, and laughed at her, and turned her

3	

3	3	into the kitchen.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There she was forced to do hard work; to rise early before daylight, to

3	

3	3	bring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash. Besides that,

3	

3	3	the sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways, and laughed at her. In the

3	

3	3	evening when she was tired, she had no bed to lie down on, but was made

3	

3	3	to lie by the hearth among the ashes; and as this, of course, made her

3	

3	3	always dusty and dirty, they called her Ashputtel.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	It happened once that the father was going to the fair, and asked his

3	

3	3	wife’s daughters what he should bring them. ‘Fine clothes,’ said the

3	

3	3	first; ‘Pearls and diamonds,’ cried the second. ‘Now, child,’ said he

3	

3	3	to his own daughter, ‘what will you have?’ ‘The first twig, dear

3	

3	3	father, that brushes against your hat when you turn your face to come

3	

3	3	homewards,’ said she. Then he bought for the first two the fine clothes

3	

3	3	and pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way home, as he

3	

3	3	rode through a green copse, a hazel twig brushed against him, and almost

3	

3	3	pushed off his hat: so he broke it off and brought it away; and when he

3	

3	3	got home he gave it to his daughter. Then she took it, and went to

3	

3	3	her mother’s grave and planted it there; and cried so much that it was

3	

3	3	watered with her tears; and there it grew and became a fine tree. Three

3	

3	3	times every day she went to it and cried; and soon a little bird came

3	

3	3	and built its nest upon the tree, and talked with her, and watched over

3	

3	3	her, and brought her whatever she wished for.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Now it happened that the king of that land held a feast, which was to

3	

3	3	last three days; and out of those who came to it his son was to choose

3	

3	3	a bride for himself. Ashputtel’s two sisters were asked to come; so they

3	

3	3	called her up, and said, ‘Now, comb our hair, brush our shoes, and tie

3	

3	3	our sashes for us, for we are going to dance at the king’s feast.’

3	

3	3	Then she did as she was told; but when all was done she could not help

3	

3	3	crying, for she thought to herself, she should so have liked to have

3	

3	3	gone with them to the ball; and at last she begged her mother very hard

3	

3	3	to let her go. ‘You, Ashputtel!’ said she; ‘you who have nothing to

3	

3	3	wear, no clothes at all, and who cannot even dance--you want to go to

3	

3	3	the ball? And when she kept on begging, she said at last, to get rid of

3	

3	3	her, ‘I will throw this dishful of peas into the ash-heap, and if in

3	

3	3	two hours’ time you have picked them all out, you shall go to the feast

3	

3	3	too.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then she threw the peas down among the ashes, but the little maiden ran

3	

3	3	out at the back door into the garden, and cried out:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Hither, hither, through the sky,

3	

3	3	  Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!

3	

3	3	  Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,

3	

3	3	  Hither, hither, haste away!

3	

3	3	  One and all come help me, quick!

3	

3	3	  Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then first came two white doves, flying in at the kitchen window; next

3	

3	3	came two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under

3	

3	3	heaven, chirping and fluttering in: and they flew down into the ashes.

3	

3	3	And the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work, pick,

3	

3	3	pick, pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick: and among

3	

3	3	them all they soon picked out all the good grain, and put it into a dish

3	

3	3	but left the ashes. Long before the end of the hour the work was quite

3	

3	3	done, and all flew out again at the windows.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the thought

3	

3	3	that now she should go to the ball. But the mother said, ‘No, no! you

3	

3	3	slut, you have no clothes, and cannot dance; you shall not go.’ And when

3	

3	3	Ashputtel begged very hard to go, she said, ‘If you can in one hour’s

3	

3	3	time pick two of those dishes of peas out of the ashes, you shall go

3	

3	3	too.’ And thus she thought she should at least get rid of her. So she

3	

3	3	shook two dishes of peas into the ashes.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the house,

3	

3	3	and cried out as before:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Hither, hither, through the sky,

3	

3	3	  Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!

3	

3	3	  Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,

3	

3	3	  Hither, hither, haste away!

3	

3	3	  One and all come help me, quick!

3	

3	3	  Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then first came two white doves in at the kitchen window; next came two

3	

3	3	turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under heaven,

3	

3	3	chirping and hopping about. And they flew down into the ashes; and the

3	

3	3	little doves put their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and

3	

3	3	then the others began pick, pick, pick; and they put all the good grain

3	

3	3	into the dishes, and left all the ashes. Before half an hour’s time all

3	

3	3	was done, and out they flew again. And then Ashputtel took the dishes to

3	

3	3	her mother, rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball.

3	

3	3	But her mother said, ‘It is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no

3	

3	3	clothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us to shame’: and off

3	

3	3	she went with her two daughters to the ball.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Now when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Ashputtel went

3	

3	3	sorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,

3	

3	3	  Gold and silver over me!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then her friend the bird flew out of the tree, and brought a gold and

3	

3	3	silver dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk; and she put them

3	

3	3	on, and followed her sisters to the feast. But they did not know her,

3	

3	3	and thought it must be some strange princess, she looked so fine and

3	

3	3	beautiful in her rich clothes; and they never once thought of Ashputtel,

3	

3	3	taking it for granted that she was safe at home in the dirt.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The king’s son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and danced

3	

3	3	with her, and no one else: and he never left her hand; but when anyone

3	

3	3	else came to ask her to dance, he said, ‘This lady is dancing with me.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Thus they danced till a late hour of the night; and then she wanted to

3	

3	3	go home: and the king’s son said, ‘I shall go and take care of you to

3	

3	3	your home’; for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived. But

3	

3	3	she slipped away from him, unawares, and ran off towards home; and as

3	

3	3	the prince followed her, she jumped up into the pigeon-house and shut

3	

3	3	the door. Then he waited till her father came home, and told him that

3	

3	3	the unknown maiden, who had been at the feast, had hid herself in the

3	

3	3	pigeon-house. But when they had broken open the door they found no one

3	

3	3	within; and as they came back into the house, Ashputtel was lying, as

3	

3	3	she always did, in her dirty frock by the ashes, and her dim little

3	

3	3	lamp was burning in the chimney. For she had run as quickly as she could

3	

3	3	through the pigeon-house and on to the hazel-tree, and had there taken

3	

3	3	off her beautiful clothes, and put them beneath the tree, that the bird

3	

3	3	might carry them away, and had lain down again amid the ashes in her

3	

3	3	little grey frock.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The next day when the feast was again held, and her father, mother, and

3	

3	3	sisters were gone, Ashputtel went to the hazel-tree, and said:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,

3	

3	3	  Gold and silver over me!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one she

3	

3	3	had worn the day before. And when she came in it to the ball, everyone

3	

3	3	wondered at her beauty: but the king’s son, who was waiting for her,

3	

3	3	took her by the hand, and danced with her; and when anyone asked her to

3	

3	3	dance, he said as before, ‘This lady is dancing with me.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When night came she wanted to go home; and the king’s son followed here

3	

3	3	as before, that he might see into what house she went: but she sprang

3	

3	3	away from him all at once into the garden behind her father’s house.

3	

3	3	In this garden stood a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit; and

3	

3	3	Ashputtel, not knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into it without

3	

3	3	being seen. Then the king’s son lost sight of her, and could not find

3	

3	3	out where she was gone, but waited till her father came home, and said

3	

3	3	to him, ‘The unknown lady who danced with me has slipped away, and I

3	

3	3	think she must have sprung into the pear-tree.’ The father thought to

3	

3	3	himself, ‘Can it be Ashputtel?’ So he had an axe brought; and they cut

3	

3	3	down the tree, but found no one upon it. And when they came back into

3	

3	3	the kitchen, there lay Ashputtel among the ashes; for she had slipped

3	

3	3	down on the other side of the tree, and carried her beautiful clothes

3	

3	3	back to the bird at the hazel-tree, and then put on her little grey

3	

3	3	frock.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The third day, when her father and mother and sisters were gone, she

3	

3	3	went again into the garden, and said:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,

3	

3	3	  Gold and silver over me!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than the

3	

3	3	former one, and slippers which were all of gold: so that when she came

3	

3	3	to the feast no one knew what to say, for wonder at her beauty: and the

3	

3	3	king’s son danced with nobody but her; and when anyone else asked her to

3	

3	3	dance, he said, ‘This lady is _my_ partner, sir.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When night came she wanted to go home; and the king’s son would go with

3	

3	3	her, and said to himself, ‘I will not lose her this time’; but, however,

3	

3	3	she again slipped away from him, though in such a hurry that she dropped

3	

3	3	her left golden slipper upon the stairs.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The prince took the shoe, and went the next day to the king his father,

3	

3	3	and said, ‘I will take for my wife the lady that this golden slipper

3	

3	3	fits.’ Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it; for they

3	

3	3	had beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the golden

3	

3	3	slipper. The eldest went first into the room where the slipper was, and

3	

3	3	wanted to try it on, and the mother stood by. But her great toe could

3	

3	3	not go into it, and the shoe was altogether much too small for her. Then

3	

3	3	the mother gave her a knife, and said, ‘Never mind, cut it off; when you

3	

3	3	are queen you will not care about toes; you will not want to walk.’ So

3	

3	3	the silly girl cut off her great toe, and thus squeezed on the shoe,

3	

3	3	and went to the king’s son. Then he took her for his bride, and set her

3	

3	3	beside him on his horse, and rode away with her homewards.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But on their way home they had to pass by the hazel-tree that Ashputtel

3	

3	3	had planted; and on the branch sat a little dove singing:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Back again! back again! look to the shoe!

3	

3	3	  The shoe is too small, and not made for you!

3	

3	3	  Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,

3	

3	3	  For she’s not the true one that sits by thy side.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw, by the

3	

3	3	blood that streamed from it, what a trick she had played him. So he

3	

3	3	turned his horse round, and brought the false bride back to her home,

3	

3	3	and said, ‘This is not the right bride; let the other sister try and put

3	

3	3	on the slipper.’ Then she went into the room and got her foot into the

3	

3	3	shoe, all but the heel, which was too large. But her mother squeezed it

3	

3	3	in till the blood came, and took her to the king’s son: and he set her

3	

3	3	as his bride by his side on his horse, and rode away with her.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But when they came to the hazel-tree the little dove sat there still,

3	

3	3	and sang:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Back again! back again! look to the shoe!

3	

3	3	  The shoe is too small, and not made for you!

3	

3	3	  Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,

3	

3	3	  For she’s not the true one that sits by thy side.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then he looked down, and saw that the blood streamed so much from the

3	

3	3	shoe, that her white stockings were quite red. So he turned his horse

3	

3	3	and brought her also back again. ‘This is not the true bride,’ said he

3	

3	3	to the father; ‘have you no other daughters?’ ‘No,’ said he; ‘there is

3	

3	3	only a little dirty Ashputtel here, the child of my first wife; I am

3	

3	3	sure she cannot be the bride.’ The prince told him to send her. But the

3	

3	3	mother said, ‘No, no, she is much too dirty; she will not dare to show

3	

3	3	herself.’ However, the prince would have her come; and she first washed

3	

3	3	her face and hands, and then went in and curtsied to him, and he reached

3	

3	3	her the golden slipper. Then she took her clumsy shoe off her left foot,

3	

3	3	and put on the golden slipper; and it fitted her as if it had been made

3	

3	3	for her. And when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her, and

3	

3	3	said, ‘This is the right bride.’ But the mother and both the sisters

3	

3	3	were frightened, and turned pale with anger as he took Ashputtel on his

3	

3	3	horse, and rode away with her. And when they came to the hazel-tree, the

3	

3	3	white dove sang:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Home! home! look at the shoe!

3	

3	3	  Princess! the shoe was made for you!

3	

3	3	  Prince! prince! take home thy bride,

3	

3	3	  For she is the true one that sits by thy side!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And when the dove had done its song, it came flying, and perched upon

3	

3	3	her right shoulder, and so went home with her.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	THE WHITE SNAKE

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	A long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom through

3	

3	3	all the land. Nothing was hidden from him, and it seemed as if news of

3	

3	3	the most secret things was brought to him through the air. But he had a

3	

3	3	strange custom; every day after dinner, when the table was cleared,

3	

3	3	and no one else was present, a trusty servant had to bring him one more

3	

3	3	dish. It was covered, however, and even the servant did not know what

3	

3	3	was in it, neither did anyone know, for the king never took off the

3	

3	3	cover to eat of it until he was quite alone.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	This had gone on for a long time, when one day the servant, who took

3	

3	3	away the dish, was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help

3	

3	3	carrying the dish into his room. When he had carefully locked the door,

3	

3	3	he lifted up the cover, and saw a white snake lying on the dish. But

3	

3	3	when he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it,

3	

3	3	so he cut of a little bit and put it into his mouth. No sooner had it

3	

3	3	touched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little voices

3	

3	3	outside his window. He went and listened, and then noticed that it was

3	

3	3	the sparrows who were chattering together, and telling one another of

3	

3	3	all kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods. Eating

3	

3	3	the snake had given him power of understanding the language of animals.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Now it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most

3	

3	3	beautiful ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty

3	

3	3	servant, who was allowed to go everywhere. The king ordered the man to

3	

3	3	be brought before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he

3	

3	3	could before the morrow point out the thief, he himself should be looked

3	

3	3	upon as guilty and executed. In vain he declared his innocence; he was

3	

3	3	dismissed with no better answer.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	In his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought

3	

3	3	how to help himself out of his trouble. Now some ducks were sitting

3	

3	3	together quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and, whilst they

3	

3	3	were making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were having a

3	

3	3	confidential conversation together. The servant stood by and listened.

3	

3	3	They were telling one another of all the places where they had been

3	

3	3	waddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found; and

3	

3	3	one said in a pitiful tone: ‘Something lies heavy on my stomach; as

3	

3	3	I was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queen’s

3	

3	3	window.’ The servant at once seized her by the neck, carried her to the

3	

3	3	kitchen, and said to the cook: ‘Here is a fine duck; pray, kill her.’

3	

3	3	‘Yes,’ said the cook, and weighed her in his hand; ‘she has spared

3	

3	3	no trouble to fatten herself, and has been waiting to be roasted long

3	

3	3	enough.’ So he cut off her head, and as she was being dressed for the

3	

3	3	spit, the queen’s ring was found inside her.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The servant could now easily prove his innocence; and the king, to make

3	

3	3	amends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favour, and promised him

3	

3	3	the best place in the court that he could wish for. The servant refused

3	

3	3	everything, and only asked for a horse and some money for travelling, as

3	

3	3	he had a mind to see the world and go about a little. When his request

3	

3	3	was granted he set out on his way, and one day came to a pond, where he

3	

3	3	saw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water. Now, though

3	

3	3	it is said that fishes are dumb, he heard them lamenting that they must

3	

3	3	perish so miserably, and, as he had a kind heart, he got off his

3	

3	3	horse and put the three prisoners back into the water. They leapt with

3	

3	3	delight, put out their heads, and cried to him: ‘We will remember you

3	

3	3	and repay you for saving us!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	He rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in

3	

3	3	the sand at his feet. He listened, and heard an ant-king complain: ‘Why

3	

3	3	cannot folks, with their clumsy beasts, keep off our bodies? That stupid

3	

3	3	horse, with his heavy hoofs, has been treading down my people without

3	

3	3	mercy!’ So he turned on to a side path and the ant-king cried out to

3	

3	3	him: ‘We will remember you--one good turn deserves another!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The path led him into a wood, and there he saw two old ravens standing

3	

3	3	by their nest, and throwing out their young ones. ‘Out with you, you

3	

3	3	idle, good-for-nothing creatures!’ cried they; ‘we cannot find food for

3	

3	3	you any longer; you are big enough, and can provide for yourselves.’

3	

3	3	But the poor young ravens lay upon the ground, flapping their wings, and

3	

3	3	crying: ‘Oh, what helpless chicks we are! We must shift for ourselves,

3	

3	3	and yet we cannot fly! What can we do, but lie here and starve?’ So the

3	

3	3	good young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword, and gave

3	

3	3	it to them for food. Then they came hopping up to it, satisfied their

3	

3	3	hunger, and cried: ‘We will remember you--one good turn deserves

3	

3	3	another!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And now he had to use his own legs, and when he had walked a long

3	

3	3	way, he came to a large city. There was a great noise and crowd in

3	

3	3	the streets, and a man rode up on horseback, crying aloud: ‘The king’s

3	

3	3	daughter wants a husband; but whoever seeks her hand must perform a hard

3	

3	3	task, and if he does not succeed he will forfeit his life.’ Many had

3	

3	3	already made the attempt, but in vain; nevertheless when the youth

3	

3	3	saw the king’s daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty that he

3	

3	3	forgot all danger, went before the king, and declared himself a suitor.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	So he was led out to the sea, and a gold ring was thrown into it, before

3	

3	3	his eyes; then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from the

3	

3	3	bottom of the sea, and added: ‘If you come up again without it you will

3	

3	3	be thrown in again and again until you perish amid the waves.’ All the

3	

3	3	people grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away, leaving him

3	

3	3	alone by the sea.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	He stood on the shore and considered what he should do, when suddenly

3	

3	3	he saw three fishes come swimming towards him, and they were the very

3	

3	3	fishes whose lives he had saved. The one in the middle held a mussel in

3	

3	3	its mouth, which it laid on the shore at the youth’s feet, and when he

3	

3	3	had taken it up and opened it, there lay the gold ring in the shell.

3	

3	3	Full of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant him

3	

3	3	the promised reward.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in

3	

3	3	birth, she scorned him, and required him first to perform another

3	

3	3	task. She went down into the garden and strewed with her own hands ten

3	

3	3	sacksful of millet-seed on the grass; then she said: ‘Tomorrow morning

3	

3	3	before sunrise these must be picked up, and not a single grain be

3	

3	3	wanting.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might be possible

3	

3	3	to perform this task, but he could think of nothing, and there he sat

3	

3	3	sorrowfully awaiting the break of day, when he should be led to death.

3	

3	3	But as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden he saw

3	

3	3	all the ten sacks standing side by side, quite full, and not a single

3	

3	3	grain was missing. The ant-king had come in the night with thousands

3	

3	3	and thousands of ants, and the grateful creatures had by great industry

3	

3	3	picked up all the millet-seed and gathered them into the sacks.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Presently the king’s daughter herself came down into the garden, and was

3	

3	3	amazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him.

3	

3	3	But she could not yet conquer her proud heart, and said: ‘Although he

3	

3	3	has performed both the tasks, he shall not be my husband until he had

3	

3	3	brought me an apple from the Tree of Life.’ The youth did not know where

3	

3	3	the Tree of Life stood, but he set out, and would have gone on for ever,

3	

3	3	as long as his legs would carry him, though he had no hope of finding

3	

3	3	it. After he had wandered through three kingdoms, he came one evening to

3	

3	3	a wood, and lay down under a tree to sleep. But he heard a rustling in

3	

3	3	the branches, and a golden apple fell into his hand. At the same time

3	

3	3	three ravens flew down to him, perched themselves upon his knee, and

3	

3	3	said: ‘We are the three young ravens whom you saved from starving; when

3	

3	3	we had grown big, and heard that you were seeking the Golden Apple,

3	

3	3	we flew over the sea to the end of the world, where the Tree of Life

3	

3	3	stands, and have brought you the apple.’ The youth, full of joy, set out

3	

3	3	homewards, and took the Golden Apple to the king’s beautiful daughter,

3	

3	3	who had now no more excuses left to make. They cut the Apple of Life in

3	

3	3	two and ate it together; and then her heart became full of love for him,

3	3	THE WOLF AND THE SEVEN LITTLE KIDS

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and

3	

3	3	loved them with all the love of a mother for her children. One day she

3	

3	3	wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called all

3	

3	3	seven to her and said: ‘Dear children, I have to go into the forest,

3	

3	3	be on your guard against the wolf; if he comes in, he will devour you

3	

3	3	all--skin, hair, and everything. The wretch often disguises himself, but

3	

3	3	you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.’ The

3	

3	3	kids said: ‘Dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves; you may go

3	

3	3	away without any anxiety.’ Then the old one bleated, and went on her way

3	

3	3	with an easy mind.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	It was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called:

3	

3	3	‘Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought

3	

3	3	something back with her for each of you.’ But the little kids knew that

3	

3	3	it was the wolf, by the rough voice. ‘We will not open the door,’ cried

3	

3	3	they, ‘you are not our mother. She has a soft, pleasant voice, but

3	

3	3	your voice is rough; you are the wolf!’ Then the wolf went away to a

3	

3	3	shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made

3	

3	3	his voice soft with it. Then he came back, knocked at the door of the

3	

3	3	house, and called: ‘Open the door, dear children, your mother is here

3	

3	3	and has brought something back with her for each of you.’ But the wolf

3	

3	3	had laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them

3	

3	3	and cried: ‘We will not open the door, our mother has not black feet

3	

3	3	like you: you are the wolf!’ Then the wolf ran to a baker and said: ‘I

3	

3	3	have hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me.’ And when the baker

3	

3	3	had rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said: ‘Strew some

3	

3	3	white meal over my feet for me.’ The miller thought to himself: ‘The

3	

3	3	wolf wants to deceive someone,’ and refused; but the wolf said: ‘If you

3	

3	3	will not do it, I will devour you.’ Then the miller was afraid, and made

3	

3	3	his paws white for him. Truly, this is the way of mankind.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	So now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at

3	

3	3	it and said: ‘Open the door for me, children, your dear little mother

3	

3	3	has come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the

3	

3	3	forest with her.’ The little kids cried: ‘First show us your paws that

3	

3	3	we may know if you are our dear little mother.’ Then he put his paws

3	

3	3	in through the window and when the kids saw that they were white, they

3	

3	3	believed that all he said was true, and opened the door. But who should

3	

3	3	come in but the wolf! They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves.

3	

3	3	One sprang under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the

3	

3	3	stove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the

3	

3	3	sixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case. But

3	

3	3	the wolf found them all, and used no great ceremony; one after the

3	

3	3	other he swallowed them down his throat. The youngest, who was in

3	

3	3	the clock-case, was the only one he did not find. When the wolf had

3	

3	3	satisfied his appetite he took himself off, laid himself down under a

3	

3	3	tree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep. Soon afterwards

3	

3	3	the old goat came home again from the forest. Ah! what a sight she saw

3	

3	3	there! The house-door stood wide open. The table, chairs, and benches

3	

3	3	were thrown down, the washing-bowl lay broken to pieces, and the quilts

3	

3	3	and pillows were pulled off the bed. She sought her children, but they

3	

3	3	were nowhere to be found. She called them one after another by name, but

3	

3	3	no one answered. At last, when she came to the youngest, a soft voice

3	

3	3	cried: ‘Dear mother, I am in the clock-case.’ She took the kid out, and

3	

3	3	it told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others. Then

3	

3	3	you may imagine how she wept over her poor children.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	At length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with her.

3	

3	3	When they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree and snored

3	

3	3	so loud that the branches shook. She looked at him on every side and

3	

3	3	saw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly. ‘Ah,

3	

3	3	heavens,’ she said, ‘is it possible that my poor children whom he has

3	

3	3	swallowed down for his supper, can be still alive?’ Then the kid had to

3	

3	3	run home and fetch scissors, and a needle and thread, and the goat cut

3	

3	3	open the monster’s stomach, and hardly had she made one cut, than one

3	

3	3	little kid thrust its head out, and when she had cut farther, all six

3	

3	3	sprang out one after another, and were all still alive, and had suffered

3	

3	3	no injury whatever, for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them

3	

3	3	down whole. What rejoicing there was! They embraced their dear mother,

3	

3	3	and jumped like a tailor at his wedding. The mother, however, said: ‘Now

3	

3	3	go and look for some big stones, and we will fill the wicked beast’s

3	

3	3	stomach with them while he is still asleep.’ Then the seven kids dragged

3	

3	3	the stones thither with all speed, and put as many of them into this

3	

3	3	stomach as they could get in; and the mother sewed him up again in the

3	

3	3	greatest haste, so that he was not aware of anything and never once

3	

3	3	stirred.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his legs,

3	

3	3	and as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to

3	

3	3	go to a well to drink. But when he began to walk and to move about, the

3	

3	3	stones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled. Then cried

3	

3	3	he:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘What rumbles and tumbles

3	

3	3	  Against my poor bones?

3	

3	3	  I thought ‘twas six kids,

3	

3	3	  But it feels like big stones.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink, the

3	

3	3	heavy stones made him fall in, and he drowned miserably. When the seven

3	

3	3	kids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud: ‘The wolf

3	

3	3	is dead! The wolf is dead!’ and danced for joy round about the well with

3	

3	3	their mother.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	THE QUEEN BEE

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Two kings’ sons once upon a time went into the world to seek their

3	

3	3	fortunes; but they soon fell into a wasteful foolish way of living, so

3	

3	3	that they could not return home again. Then their brother, who was a

3	

3	3	little insignificant dwarf, went out to seek for his brothers: but when

3	

3	3	he had found them they only laughed at him, to think that he, who was so

3	

3	3	young and simple, should try to travel through the world, when they, who

3	

3	3	were so much wiser, had been unable to get on. However, they all set

3	

3	3	out on their journey together, and came at last to an ant-hill. The two

3	

3	3	elder brothers would have pulled it down, in order to see how the poor

3	

3	3	ants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs. But the

3	

3	3	little dwarf said, ‘Let the poor things enjoy themselves, I will not

3	

3	3	suffer you to trouble them.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	So on they went, and came to a lake where many many ducks were swimming

3	

3	3	about. The two brothers wanted to catch two, and roast them. But the

3	

3	3	dwarf said, ‘Let the poor things enjoy themselves, you shall not kill

3	

3	3	them.’ Next they came to a bees’-nest in a hollow tree, and there was

3	

3	3	so much honey that it ran down the trunk; and the two brothers wanted to

3	

3	3	light a fire under the tree and kill the bees, so as to get their honey.

3	

3	3	But the dwarf held them back, and said, ‘Let the pretty insects enjoy

3	

3	3	themselves, I cannot let you burn them.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	At length the three brothers came to a castle: and as they passed by the

3	

3	3	stables they saw fine horses standing there, but all were of marble, and

3	

3	3	no man was to be seen. Then they went through all the rooms, till they

3	

3	3	came to a door on which were three locks: but in the middle of the door

3	

3	3	was a wicket, so that they could look into the next room. There they saw

3	

3	3	a little grey old man sitting at a table; and they called to him once or

3	

3	3	twice, but he did not hear: however, they called a third time, and then

3	

3	3	he rose and came out to them.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	He said nothing, but took hold of them and led them to a beautiful

3	

3	3	table covered with all sorts of good things: and when they had eaten and

3	

3	3	drunk, he showed each of them to a bed-chamber.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The next morning he came to the eldest and took him to a marble table,

3	

3	3	where there were three tablets, containing an account of the means by

3	

3	3	which the castle might be disenchanted. The first tablet said: ‘In the

3	

3	3	wood, under the moss, lie the thousand pearls belonging to the king’s

3	

3	3	daughter; they must all be found: and if one be missing by set of sun,

3	

3	3	he who seeks them will be turned into marble.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The eldest brother set out, and sought for the pearls the whole day:

3	

3	3	but the evening came, and he had not found the first hundred: so he was

3	

3	3	turned into stone as the tablet had foretold.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The next day the second brother undertook the task; but he succeeded no

3	

3	3	better than the first; for he could only find the second hundred of the

3	

3	3	pearls; and therefore he too was turned into stone.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	At last came the little dwarf’s turn; and he looked in the moss; but it

3	

3	3	was so hard to find the pearls, and the job was so tiresome!--so he sat

3	

3	3	down upon a stone and cried. And as he sat there, the king of the ants

3	

3	3	(whose life he had saved) came to help him, with five thousand ants; and

3	

3	3	it was not long before they had found all the pearls and laid them in a

3	

3	3	heap.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The second tablet said: ‘The key of the princess’s bed-chamber must be

3	

3	3	fished up out of the lake.’ And as the dwarf came to the brink of it,

3	

3	3	he saw the two ducks whose lives he had saved swimming about; and they

3	

3	3	dived down and soon brought in the key from the bottom.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The third task was the hardest. It was to choose out the youngest and

3	

3	3	the best of the king’s three daughters. Now they were all beautiful, and

3	

3	3	all exactly alike: but he was told that the eldest had eaten a piece of

3	

3	3	sugar, the next some sweet syrup, and the youngest a spoonful of honey;

3	

3	3	so he was to guess which it was that had eaten the honey.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then came the queen of the bees, who had been saved by the little dwarf

3	

3	3	from the fire, and she tried the lips of all three; but at last she sat

3	

3	3	upon the lips of the one that had eaten the honey: and so the dwarf knew

3	

3	3	which was the youngest. Thus the spell was broken, and all who had been

3	

3	3	turned into stones awoke, and took their proper forms. And the dwarf

3	

3	3	married the youngest and the best of the princesses, and was king after

3	

3	3	her father’s death; but his two brothers married the other two sisters.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest:

3	

3	3	but still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he

3	

3	3	had in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of

3	

3	3	shoes.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then he cut his leather out, all ready to make up the next day, meaning

3	

3	3	to rise early in the morning to his work. His conscience was clear and

3	

3	3	his heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed,

3	

3	3	left all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep. In the morning after

3	

3	3	he had said his prayers, he sat himself down to his work; when, to his

3	

3	3	great wonder, there stood the shoes all ready made, upon the table. The

3	

3	3	good man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening.

3	

3	3	He looked at the workmanship; there was not one false stitch in the

3	

3	3	whole job; all was so neat and true, that it was quite a masterpiece.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The same day a customer came in, and the shoes suited him so well that

3	

3	3	he willingly paid a price higher than usual for them; and the poor

3	

3	3	shoemaker, with the money, bought leather enough to make two pairs more.

3	

3	3	In the evening he cut out the work, and went to bed early, that he might

3	

3	3	get up and begin betimes next day; but he was saved all the trouble, for

3	

3	3	when he got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand. Soon

3	

3	3	in came buyers, who paid him handsomely for his goods, so that he bought

3	

3	3	leather enough for four pair more. He cut out the work again overnight

3	

3	3	and found it done in the morning, as before; and so it went on for some

3	

3	3	time: what was got ready in the evening was always done by daybreak, and

3	

3	3	the good man soon became thriving and well off again.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	One evening, about Christmas-time, as he and his wife were sitting over

3	

3	3	the fire chatting together, he said to her, ‘I should like to sit up and

3	

3	3	watch tonight, that we may see who it is that comes and does my work for

3	

3	3	me.’ The wife liked the thought; so they left a light burning, and hid

3	

3	3	themselves in a corner of the room, behind a curtain that was hung up

3	

3	3	there, and watched what would happen.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	As soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs; and

3	

3	3	they sat themselves upon the shoemaker’s bench, took up all the work

3	

3	3	that was cut out, and began to ply with their little fingers, stitching

3	

3	3	and rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that the shoemaker was all

3	

3	3	wonder, and could not take his eyes off them. And on they went, till the

3	

3	3	job was quite done, and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table.

3	

3	3	This was long before daybreak; and then they bustled away as quick as

3	

3	3	lightning.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The next day the wife said to the shoemaker. ‘These little wights have

3	

3	3	made us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them a good

3	

3	3	turn if we can. I am quite sorry to see them run about as they do; and

3	

3	3	indeed it is not very decent, for they have nothing upon their backs to

3	

3	3	keep off the cold. I’ll tell you what, I will make each of them a shirt,

3	

3	3	and a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain; and

3	

3	3	do you make each of them a little pair of shoes.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening, when

3	

3	3	all the things were ready, they laid them on the table, instead of the

3	

3	3	work that they used to cut out, and then went and hid themselves, to

3	

3	3	watch what the little elves would do.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	About midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the

3	

3	3	room, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they

3	

3	3	saw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed

3	

3	3	mightily delighted.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and danced and

3	

3	3	capered and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at last they danced

3	

3	3	out at the door, and away over the green.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them

3	

3	3	from that time forward, as long as they lived.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	THE JUNIPER-TREE

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Long, long ago, some two thousand years or so, there lived a rich

3	

3	3	man with a good and beautiful wife. They loved each other dearly, but

3	

3	3	sorrowed much that they had no children. So greatly did they desire

3	

3	3	to have one, that the wife prayed for it day and night, but still they

3	

3	3	remained childless.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	In front of the house there was a court, in which grew a juniper-tree.

3	

3	3	One winter’s day the wife stood under the tree to peel some apples, and

3	

3	3	as she was peeling them, she cut her finger, and the blood fell on the

3	

3	3	snow. ‘Ah,’ sighed the woman heavily, ‘if I had but a child, as red as

3	

3	3	blood and as white as snow,’ and as she spoke the words, her heart grew

3	

3	3	light within her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and

3	

3	3	she returned to the house feeling glad and comforted. A month passed,

3	

3	3	and the snow had all disappeared; then another month went by, and all

3	

3	3	the earth was green. So the months followed one another, and first the

3	

3	3	trees budded in the woods, and soon the green branches grew thickly

3	

3	3	intertwined, and then the blossoms began to fall. Once again the wife

3	

3	3	stood under the juniper-tree, and it was so full of sweet scent that her

3	

3	3	heart leaped for joy, and she was so overcome with her happiness, that

3	

3	3	she fell on her knees. Presently the fruit became round and firm, and

3	

3	3	she was glad and at peace; but when they were fully ripe she picked the

3	

3	3	berries and ate eagerly of them, and then she grew sad and ill. A little

3	

3	3	while later she called her husband, and said to him, weeping. ‘If I

3	

3	3	die, bury me under the juniper-tree.’ Then she felt comforted and happy

3	

3	3	again, and before another month had passed she had a little child, and

3	

3	3	when she saw that it was as white as snow and as red as blood, her joy

3	

3	3	was so great that she died.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Her husband buried her under the juniper-tree, and wept bitterly for

3	

3	3	her. By degrees, however, his sorrow grew less, and although at times he

3	

3	3	still grieved over his loss, he was able to go about as usual, and later

3	

3	3	on he married again.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	He now had a little daughter born to him; the child of his first wife

3	

3	3	was a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow. The mother

3	

3	3	loved her daughter very much, and when she looked at her and then looked

3	

3	3	at the boy, it pierced her heart to think that he would always stand in

3	

3	3	the way of her own child, and she was continually thinking how she could

3	

3	3	get the whole of the property for her. This evil thought took possession

3	

3	3	of her more and more, and made her behave very unkindly to the boy. She

3	

3	3	drove him from place to place with cuffings and buffetings, so that the

3	

3	3	poor child went about in fear, and had no peace from the time he left

3	

3	3	school to the time he went back.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	One day the little daughter came running to her mother in the

3	

3	3	store-room, and said, ‘Mother, give me an apple.’ ‘Yes, my child,’ said

3	

3	3	the wife, and she gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest; the chest

3	

3	3	had a very heavy lid and a large iron lock.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Mother,’ said the little daughter again, ‘may not brother have one

3	

3	3	too?’ The mother was angry at this, but she answered, ‘Yes, when he

3	

3	3	comes out of school.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Just then she looked out of the window and saw him coming, and it seemed

3	

3	3	as if an evil spirit entered into her, for she snatched the apple out

3	

3	3	of her little daughter’s hand, and said, ‘You shall not have one before

3	

3	3	your brother.’ She threw the apple into the chest and shut it to. The

3	

3	3	little boy now came in, and the evil spirit in the wife made her say

3	

3	3	kindly to him, ‘My son, will you have an apple?’ but she gave him a

3	

3	3	wicked look. ‘Mother,’ said the boy, ‘how dreadful you look! Yes, give

3	

3	3	me an apple.’ The thought came to her that she would kill him. ‘Come

3	

3	3	with me,’ she said, and she lifted up the lid of the chest; ‘take one

3	

3	3	out for yourself.’ And as he bent over to do so, the evil spirit urged

3	

3	3	her, and crash! down went the lid, and off went the little boy’s head.

3	

3	3	Then she was overwhelmed with fear at the thought of what she had done.

3	

3	3	‘If only I can prevent anyone knowing that I did it,’ she thought. So

3	

3	3	she went upstairs to her room, and took a white handkerchief out of

3	

3	3	her top drawer; then she set the boy’s head again on his shoulders, and

3	

3	3	bound it with the handkerchief so that nothing could be seen, and placed

3	

3	3	him on a chair by the door with an apple in his hand.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Soon after this, little Marleen came up to her mother who was stirring

3	

3	3	a pot of boiling water over the fire, and said, ‘Mother, brother is

3	

3	3	sitting by the door with an apple in his hand, and he looks so pale;

3	

3	3	and when I asked him to give me the apple, he did not answer, and that

3	

3	3	frightened me.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Go to him again,’ said her mother, ‘and if he does not answer, give him

3	

3	3	a box on the ear.’ So little Marleen went, and said, ‘Brother, give me

3	

3	3	that apple,’ but he did not say a word; then she gave him a box on the

3	

3	3	ear, and his head rolled off. She was so terrified at this, that she ran

3	

3	3	crying and screaming to her mother. ‘Oh!’ she said, ‘I have knocked off

3	

3	3	brother’s head,’ and then she wept and wept, and nothing would stop her.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘What have you done!’ said her mother, ‘but no one must know about it,

3	

3	3	so you must keep silence; what is done can’t be undone; we will make

3	

3	3	him into puddings.’ And she took the little boy and cut him up, made him

3	

3	3	into puddings, and put him in the pot. But Marleen stood looking on,

3	

3	3	and wept and wept, and her tears fell into the pot, so that there was no

3	

3	3	need of salt.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Presently the father came home and sat down to his dinner; he asked,

3	

3	3	‘Where is my son?’ The mother said nothing, but gave him a large dish of

3	

3	3	black pudding, and Marleen still wept without ceasing.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The father again asked, ‘Where is my son?’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Oh,’ answered the wife, ‘he is gone into the country to his mother’s

3	

3	3	great uncle; he is going to stay there some time.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘What has he gone there for, and he never even said goodbye to me!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Well, he likes being there, and he told me he should be away quite six

3	

3	3	weeks; he is well looked after there.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘I feel very unhappy about it,’ said the husband, ‘in case it should not

3	

3	3	be all right, and he ought to have said goodbye to me.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	With this he went on with his dinner, and said, ‘Little Marleen, why do

3	

3	3	you weep? Brother will soon be back.’ Then he asked his wife for more

3	

3	3	pudding, and as he ate, he threw the bones under the table.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Little Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out of

3	

3	3	her bottom drawer, and in it she wrapped all the bones from under the

3	

3	3	table and carried them outside, and all the time she did nothing but

3	

3	3	weep. Then she laid them in the green grass under the juniper-tree, and

3	

3	3	she had no sooner done so, then all her sadness seemed to leave her,

3	

3	3	and she wept no more. And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the

3	

3	3	branches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and

3	

3	3	then together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for

3	

3	3	joy. After this a mist came round the tree, and in the midst of it there

3	

3	3	was a burning as of fire, and out of the fire there flew a beautiful

3	

3	3	bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently, and when it

3	

3	3	could no more be seen, the juniper-tree stood there as before, and the

3	

3	3	silk handkerchief and the bones were gone.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Little Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother were

3	

3	3	still alive, and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to

3	

3	3	the table and ate.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The bird flew away and alighted on the house of a goldsmith and began to

3	

3	3	sing:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘My mother killed her little son;

3	

3	3	  My father grieved when I was gone;

3	

3	3	  My sister loved me best of all;

3	

3	3	  She laid her kerchief over me,

3	

3	3	  And took my bones that they might lie

3	

3	3	  Underneath the juniper-tree

3	

3	3	  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The goldsmith was in his workshop making a gold chain, when he heard the

3	

3	3	song of the bird on his roof. He thought it so beautiful that he got

3	

3	3	up and ran out, and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his

3	

3	3	slippers. But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on

3	

3	3	one foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still

3	

3	3	held the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing

3	

3	3	up at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Bird,’ he said, ‘how beautifully you sing! Sing me that song again.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Nay,’ said the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing. Give that gold

3	

3	3	chain, and I will sing it you again.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Here is the chain, take it,’ said the goldsmith. ‘Only sing me that

3	

3	3	again.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The bird flew down and took the gold chain in his right claw, and then

3	

3	3	he alighted again in front of the goldsmith and sang:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘My mother killed her little son;

3	

3	3	  My father grieved when I was gone;

3	

3	3	  My sister loved me best of all;

3	

3	3	  She laid her kerchief over me,

3	

3	3	  And took my bones that they might lie

3	

3	3	  Underneath the juniper-tree

3	

3	3	  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then he flew away, and settled on the roof of a shoemaker’s house and

3	

3	3	sang:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘My mother killed her little son;

3	

3	3	  My father grieved when I was gone;

3	

3	3	  My sister loved me best of all;

3	

3	3	  She laid her kerchief over me,

3	

3	3	  And took my bones that they might lie

3	

3	3	  Underneath the juniper-tree

3	

3	3	  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The shoemaker heard him, and he jumped up and ran out in his

3	

3	3	shirt-sleeves, and stood looking up at the bird on the roof with his

3	

3	3	hand over his eyes to keep himself from being blinded by the sun.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Bird,’ he said, ‘how beautifully you sing!’ Then he called through the

3	

3	3	door to his wife: ‘Wife, come out; here is a bird, come and look at it

3	

3	3	and hear how beautifully it sings.’ Then he called his daughter and the

3	

3	3	children, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all ran up the

3	

3	3	street to look at the bird, and saw how splendid it was with its red

3	

3	3	and green feathers, and its neck like burnished gold, and eyes like two

3	

3	3	bright stars in its head.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Bird,’ said the shoemaker, ‘sing me that song again.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Nay,’ answered the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing; you must

3	

3	3	give me something.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Wife,’ said the man, ‘go into the garret; on the upper shelf you will

3	

3	3	see a pair of red shoes; bring them to me.’ The wife went in and fetched

3	

3	3	the shoes.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘There, bird,’ said the shoemaker, ‘now sing me that song again.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The bird flew down and took the red shoes in his left claw, and then he

3	

3	3	went back to the roof and sang:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘My mother killed her little son;

3	

3	3	  My father grieved when I was gone;

3	

3	3	  My sister loved me best of all;

3	

3	3	  She laid her kerchief over me,

3	

3	3	  And took my bones that they might lie

3	

3	3	  Underneath the juniper-tree

3	

3	3	  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When he had finished, he flew away. He had the chain in his right claw

3	

3	3	and the shoes in his left, and he flew right away to a mill, and the

3	

3	3	mill went ‘Click clack, click clack, click clack.’ Inside the mill were

3	

3	3	twenty of the miller’s men hewing a stone, and as they went ‘Hick hack,

3	

3	3	hick hack, hick hack,’ the mill went ‘Click clack, click clack, click

3	

3	3	clack.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The bird settled on a lime-tree in front of the mill and sang:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘My mother killed her little son;

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	then one of the men left off,

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	  My father grieved when I was gone;

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	two more men left off and listened,

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	  My sister loved me best of all;

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	then four more left off,

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	  She laid her kerchief over me,

3	

3	3	  And took my bones that they might lie

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	now there were only eight at work,

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	  Underneath

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And now only five,

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	  the juniper-tree.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And now only one,

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	then he looked up and the last one had left off work.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Bird,’ he said, ‘what a beautiful song that is you sing! Let me hear it

3	

3	3	too; sing it again.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Nay,’ answered the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing; give me that

3	

3	3	millstone, and I will sing it again.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘If it belonged to me alone,’ said the man, ‘you should have it.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Yes, yes,’ said the others: ‘if he will sing again, he can have it.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The bird came down, and all the twenty millers set to and lifted up the

3	

3	3	stone with a beam; then the bird put his head through the hole and took

3	

3	3	the stone round his neck like a collar, and flew back with it to the

3	

3	3	tree and sang--

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘My mother killed her little son;

3	

3	3	  My father grieved when I was gone;

3	

3	3	  My sister loved me best of all;

3	

3	3	  She laid her kerchief over me,

3	

3	3	  And took my bones that they might lie

3	

3	3	  Underneath the juniper-tree

3	

3	3	  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And when he had finished his song, he spread his wings, and with the

3	

3	3	chain in his right claw, the shoes in his left, and the millstone round

3	

3	3	his neck, he flew right away to his father’s house.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The father, the mother, and little Marleen were having their dinner.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘How lighthearted I feel,’ said the father, ‘so pleased and cheerful.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘And I,’ said the mother, ‘I feel so uneasy, as if a heavy thunderstorm

3	

3	3	were coming.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But little Marleen sat and wept and wept.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the bird came flying towards the house and settled on the roof.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘I do feel so happy,’ said the father, ‘and how beautifully the sun

3	

3	3	shines; I feel just as if I were going to see an old friend again.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Ah!’ said the wife, ‘and I am so full of distress and uneasiness that

3	

3	3	my teeth chatter, and I feel as if there were a fire in my veins,’ and

3	

3	3	she tore open her dress; and all the while little Marleen sat in the

3	

3	3	corner and wept, and the plate on her knees was wet with her tears.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The bird now flew to the juniper-tree and began singing:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘My mother killed her little son;

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	the mother shut her eyes and her ears, that she might see and hear

3	

3	3	nothing, but there was a roaring sound in her ears like that of a

3	

3	3	violent storm, and in her eyes a burning and flashing like lightning:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	  My father grieved when I was gone;

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Look, mother,’ said the man, ‘at the beautiful bird that is singing so

3	

3	3	magnificently; and how warm and bright the sun is, and what a delicious

3	

3	3	scent of spice in the air!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	  My sister loved me best of all;

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	then little Marleen laid her head down on her knees and sobbed.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘I must go outside and see the bird nearer,’ said the man.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Ah, do not go!’ cried the wife. ‘I feel as if the whole house were in

3	

3	3	flames!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But the man went out and looked at the bird.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 She laid her kerchief over me,

3	

3	3	 And took my bones that they might lie

3	

3	3	 Underneath the juniper-tree

3	

3	3	 Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	With that the bird let fall the gold chain, and it fell just round the

3	

3	3	man’s neck, so that it fitted him exactly.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	He went inside, and said, ‘See, what a splendid bird that is; he has

3	

3	3	given me this beautiful gold chain, and looks so beautiful himself.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But the wife was in such fear and trouble, that she fell on the floor,

3	

3	3	and her cap fell from her head.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the bird began again:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘My mother killed her little son;

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Ah me!’ cried the wife, ‘if I were but a thousand feet beneath the

3	

3	3	earth, that I might not hear that song.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	  My father grieved when I was gone;

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	then the woman fell down again as if dead.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	  My sister loved me best of all;

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Well,’ said little Marleen, ‘I will go out too and see if the bird will

3	

3	3	give me anything.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	So she went out.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	  She laid her kerchief over me,

3	

3	3	  And took my bones that they might lie

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	and he threw down the shoes to her,

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	  Underneath the juniper-tree

3	

3	3	  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And she now felt quite happy and lighthearted; she put on the shoes and

3	

3	3	danced and jumped about in them. ‘I was so miserable,’ she said, ‘when I

3	

3	3	came out, but that has all passed away; that is indeed a splendid bird,

3	

3	3	and he has given me a pair of red shoes.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The wife sprang up, with her hair standing out from her head like flames

3	

3	3	of fire. ‘Then I will go out too,’ she said, ‘and see if it will lighten

3	

3	3	my misery, for I feel as if the world were coming to an end.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But as she crossed the threshold, crash! the bird threw the millstone

3	

3	3	down on her head, and she was crushed to death.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The father and little Marleen heard the sound and ran out, but they only

3	

3	3	saw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot, and when these had

3	

3	3	passed, there stood the little brother, and he took the father and

3	

3	3	little Marleen by the hand; then they all three rejoiced, and went

3	

3	3	inside together and sat down to their dinners and ate.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	THE TURNIP

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There were two brothers who were both soldiers; the one was rich and

3	

3	3	the other poor. The poor man thought he would try to better himself; so,

3	

3	3	pulling off his red coat, he became a gardener, and dug his ground well,

3	

3	3	and sowed turnips.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When the seed came up, there was one plant bigger than all the rest; and

3	

3	3	it kept getting larger and larger, and seemed as if it would never cease

3	

3	3	growing; so that it might have been called the prince of turnips for

3	

3	3	there never was such a one seen before, and never will again. At last it

3	

3	3	was so big that it filled a cart, and two oxen could hardly draw it; and

3	

3	3	the gardener knew not what in the world to do with it, nor whether it

3	

3	3	would be a blessing or a curse to him. One day he said to himself, ‘What

3	

3	3	shall I do with it? if I sell it, it will bring no more than another;

3	

3	3	and for eating, the little turnips are better than this; the best thing

3	

3	3	perhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then he yoked his oxen, and drew the turnip to the court, and gave it

3	

3	3	to the king. ‘What a wonderful thing!’ said the king; ‘I have seen many

3	

3	3	strange things, but such a monster as this I never saw. Where did you

3	

3	3	get the seed? or is it only your good luck? If so, you are a true child

3	

3	3	of fortune.’ ‘Ah, no!’ answered the gardener, ‘I am no child of fortune;

3	

3	3	I am a poor soldier, who never could get enough to live upon; so I

3	

3	3	laid aside my red coat, and set to work, tilling the ground. I have a

3	

3	3	brother, who is rich, and your majesty knows him well, and all the world

3	

3	3	knows him; but because I am poor, everybody forgets me.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The king then took pity on him, and said, ‘You shall be poor no

3	

3	3	longer. I will give you so much that you shall be even richer than your

3	

3	3	brother.’ Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks, and made him so

3	

3	3	rich that his brother’s fortune could not at all be compared with his.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When the brother heard of all this, and how a turnip had made the

3	

3	3	gardener so rich, he envied him sorely, and bethought himself how he

3	

3	3	could contrive to get the same good fortune for himself. However, he

3	

3	3	determined to manage more cleverly than his brother, and got together a

3	

3	3	rich present of gold and fine horses for the king; and thought he must

3	

3	3	have a much larger gift in return; for if his brother had received so

3	

3	3	much for only a turnip, what must his present be worth?

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The king took the gift very graciously, and said he knew not what to

3	

3	3	give in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip; so

3	

3	3	the soldier was forced to put it into a cart, and drag it home with him.

3	

3	3	When he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite;

3	

3	3	and at length wicked thoughts came into his head, and he resolved to

3	

3	3	kill his brother.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	So he hired some villains to murder him; and having shown them where to

3	

3	3	lie in ambush, he went to his brother, and said, ‘Dear brother, I have

3	

3	3	found a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up, and share it between

3	

3	3	us.’ The other had no suspicions of his roguery: so they went out

3	

3	3	together, and as they were travelling along, the murderers rushed out

3	

3	3	upon him, bound him, and were going to hang him on a tree.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But whilst they were getting all ready, they heard the trampling of a

3	

3	3	horse at a distance, which so frightened them that they pushed their

3	

3	3	prisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung him up by a

3	

3	3	cord to the tree, where they left him dangling, and ran away. Meantime

3	

3	3	he worked and worked away, till he made a hole large enough to put out

3	

3	3	his head.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When the horseman came up, he proved to be a student, a merry fellow,

3	

3	3	who was journeying along on his nag, and singing as he went. As soon as

3	

3	3	the man in the sack saw him passing under the tree, he cried out, ‘Good

3	

3	3	morning! good morning to thee, my friend!’ The student looked about

3	

3	3	everywhere; and seeing no one, and not knowing where the voice came

3	

3	3	from, cried out, ‘Who calls me?’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the man in the tree answered, ‘Lift up thine eyes, for behold here

3	

3	3	I sit in the sack of wisdom; here have I, in a short time, learned great

3	

3	3	and wondrous things. Compared to this seat, all the learning of the

3	

3	3	schools is as empty air. A little longer, and I shall know all that man

3	

3	3	can know, and shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind. Here

3	

3	3	I discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars; the laws

3	

3	3	that control the winds; the number of the sands on the seashore; the

3	

3	3	healing of the sick; the virtues of all simples, of birds, and of

3	

3	3	precious stones. Wert thou but once here, my friend, though wouldst feel

3	

3	3	and own the power of knowledge.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The student listened to all this and wondered much; at last he said,

3	

3	3	‘Blessed be the day and hour when I found you; cannot you contrive to

3	

3	3	let me into the sack for a little while?’ Then the other answered, as if

3	

3	3	very unwillingly, ‘A little space I may allow thee to sit here, if thou

3	

3	3	wilt reward me well and entreat me kindly; but thou must tarry yet an

3	

3	3	hour below, till I have learnt some little matters that are yet unknown

3	

3	3	to me.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	So the student sat himself down and waited a while; but the time hung

3	

3	3	heavy upon him, and he begged earnestly that he might ascend forthwith,

3	

3	3	for his thirst for knowledge was great. Then the other pretended to give

3	

3	3	way, and said, ‘Thou must let the sack of wisdom descend, by untying

3	

3	3	yonder cord, and then thou shalt enter.’ So the student let him down,

3	

3	3	opened the sack, and set him free. ‘Now then,’ cried he, ‘let me ascend

3	

3	3	quickly.’ As he began to put himself into the sack heels first, ‘Wait a

3	

3	3	while,’ said the gardener, ‘that is not the way.’ Then he pushed him

3	

3	3	in head first, tied up the sack, and soon swung up the searcher after

3	

3	3	wisdom dangling in the air. ‘How is it with thee, friend?’ said he,

3	

3	3	‘dost thou not feel that wisdom comes unto thee? Rest there in peace,

3	

3	3	till thou art a wiser man than thou wert.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	So saying, he trotted off on the student’s nag, and left the poor fellow

3	

3	3	to gather wisdom till somebody should come and let him down.

3	

3	3

3	

3	3	CLEVER HANS

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The mother of Hans said: ‘Whither away, Hans?’ Hans answered: ‘To

3	

3	3	Gretel.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh, I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’

3	

3	3	‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day,

3	

3	3	Hans. What do you bring that is good?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want to have

3	

3	3	something given me.’ Gretel presents Hans with a needle, Hans says:

3	

3	3	‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Hans takes the needle, sticks it into a hay-cart, and follows the cart

3	

3	3	home. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’

3	

3	3	‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘Took nothing; had something

3	

3	3	given me.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a needle.’ ‘Where is the

3	

3	3	needle, Hans?’ ‘Stuck in the hay-cart.’ ‘That was ill done, Hans. You

3	

3	3	should have stuck the needle in your sleeve.’ ‘Never mind, I’ll do

3	

3	3	better next time.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,

3	

3	3	I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to

3	

3	3	Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What do you bring that is

3	

3	3	good?’ ‘I bring nothing. I want to have something given to me.’ Gretel

3	

3	3	presents Hans with a knife. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans

3	

3	3	takes the knife, sticks it in his sleeve, and goes home. ‘Good evening,

3	

3	3	mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ What

3	

3	3	did you take her?’ ‘Took her nothing, she gave me something.’ ‘What did

3	

3	3	Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a knife.’ ‘Where is the knife, Hans?’ ‘Stuck

3	

3	3	in my sleeve.’ ‘That’s ill done, Hans, you should have put the knife in

3	

3	3	your pocket.’ ‘Never mind, will do better next time.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,

3	

3	3	I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to

3	

3	3	Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good thing do you

3	

3	3	bring?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want something given me.’ Gretel presents

3	

3	3	Hans with a young goat. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans takes

3	

3	3	the goat, ties its legs, and puts it in his pocket. When he gets home it

3	

3	3	is suffocated. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have

3	

3	3	you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘Took nothing, she

3	

3	3	gave me something.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘She gave me a goat.’

3	

3	3	‘Where is the goat, Hans?’ ‘Put it in my pocket.’ ‘That was ill done,

3	

3	3	Hans, you should have put a rope round the goat’s neck.’ ‘Never mind,

3	

3	3	will do better next time.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,

3	

3	3	I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to

3	

3	3	Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good thing do you

3	

3	3	bring?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want something given me.’ Gretel presents

3	

3	3	Hans with a piece of bacon. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Hans takes the bacon, ties it to a rope, and drags it away behind him.

3	

3	3	The dogs come and devour the bacon. When he gets home, he has the rope

3	

3	3	in his hand, and there is no longer anything hanging on to it. ‘Good

3	

3	3	evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With

3	

3	3	Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘I took her nothing, she gave me

3	

3	3	something.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a bit of bacon.’ ‘Where

3	

3	3	is the bacon, Hans?’ ‘I tied it to a rope, brought it home, dogs took

3	

3	3	it.’ ‘That was ill done, Hans, you should have carried the bacon on your

3	

3	3	head.’ ‘Never mind, will do better next time.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘I’ll

3	

3	3	behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to Gretel.

3	

3	3	‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans, What good thing do you bring?’ ‘I

3	

3	3	bring nothing, but would have something given.’ Gretel presents Hans

3	

3	3	with a calf. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Hans takes the calf, puts it on his head, and the calf kicks his face.

3	

3	3	‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With

3	

3	3	Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘I took nothing, but had something

3	

3	3	given me.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘A calf.’ ‘Where have you the

3	

3	3	calf, Hans?’ ‘I set it on my head and it kicked my face.’ ‘That was

3	

3	3	ill done, Hans, you should have led the calf, and put it in the stall.’

3	

3	3	‘Never mind, will do better next time.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘I’ll

3	

3	3	behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Hans comes to Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good

3	

3	3	thing do you bring?’ ‘I bring nothing, but would have something given.’

3	

3	3	Gretel says to Hans: ‘I will go with you.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Hans takes Gretel, ties her to a rope, leads her to the rack, and binds

3	

3	3	her fast. Then Hans goes to his mother. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good

3	

3	3	evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take

3	

3	3	her?’ ‘I took her nothing.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘She gave me

3	

3	3	nothing, she came with me.’ ‘Where have you left Gretel?’ ‘I led her by

3	

3	3	the rope, tied her to the rack, and scattered some grass for her.’ ‘That

3	

3	3	was ill done, Hans, you should have cast friendly eyes on her.’ ‘Never

3	

3	3	mind, will do better.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Hans went into the stable, cut out all the calves’ and sheep’s eyes,

3	

3	3	and threw them in Gretel’s face. Then Gretel became angry, tore herself

3	

3	3	loose and ran away, and was no longer the bride of Hans.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	THE THREE LANGUAGES

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	An aged count once lived in Switzerland, who had an only son, but he

3	

3	3	was stupid, and could learn nothing. Then said the father: ‘Hark you,

3	

3	3	my son, try as I will I can get nothing into your head. You must go from

3	

3	3	hence, I will give you into the care of a celebrated master, who shall

3	

3	3	see what he can do with you.’ The youth was sent into a strange town,

3	

3	3	and remained a whole year with the master. At the end of this time,

3	

3	3	he came home again, and his father asked: ‘Now, my son, what have you

3	

3	3	learnt?’ ‘Father, I have learnt what the dogs say when they bark.’ ‘Lord

3	

3	3	have mercy on us!’ cried the father; ‘is that all you have learnt? I

3	

3	3	will send you into another town, to another master.’ The youth was taken

3	

3	3	thither, and stayed a year with this master likewise. When he came back

3	

3	3	the father again asked: ‘My son, what have you learnt?’ He answered:

3	

3	3	‘Father, I have learnt what the birds say.’ Then the father fell into a

3	

3	3	rage and said: ‘Oh, you lost man, you have spent the precious time and

3	

3	3	learnt nothing; are you not ashamed to appear before my eyes? I will

3	

3	3	send you to a third master, but if you learn nothing this time also, I

3	

3	3	will no longer be your father.’ The youth remained a whole year with the

3	

3	3	third master also, and when he came home again, and his father inquired:

3	

3	3	‘My son, what have you learnt?’ he answered: ‘Dear father, I have this

3	

3	3	year learnt what the frogs croak.’ Then the father fell into the most

3	

3	3	furious anger, sprang up, called his people thither, and said: ‘This man

3	

3	3	is no longer my son, I drive him forth, and command you to take him

3	

3	3	out into the forest, and kill him.’ They took him forth, but when they

3	

3	3	should have killed him, they could not do it for pity, and let him go,

3	

3	3	and they cut the eyes and tongue out of a deer that they might carry

3	

3	3	them to the old man as a token.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress where he

3	

3	3	begged for a night’s lodging. ‘Yes,’ said the lord of the castle, ‘if

3	

3	3	you will pass the night down there in the old tower, go thither; but I

3	

3	3	warn you, it is at the peril of your life, for it is full of wild dogs,

3	

3	3	which bark and howl without stopping, and at certain hours a man has to

3	

3	3	be given to them, whom they at once devour.’ The whole district was in

3	

3	3	sorrow and dismay because of them, and yet no one could do anything to

3	

3	3	stop this. The youth, however, was without fear, and said: ‘Just let me

3	

3	3	go down to the barking dogs, and give me something that I can throw to

3	

3	3	them; they will do nothing to harm me.’ As he himself would have it so,

3	

3	3	they gave him some food for the wild animals, and led him down to the

3	

3	3	tower. When he went inside, the dogs did not bark at him, but wagged

3	

3	3	their tails quite amicably around him, ate what he set before them, and

3	

3	3	did not hurt one hair of his head. Next morning, to the astonishment of

3	

3	3	everyone, he came out again safe and unharmed, and said to the lord of

3	

3	3	the castle: ‘The dogs have revealed to me, in their own language, why

3	

3	3	they dwell there, and bring evil on the land. They are bewitched, and

3	

3	3	are obliged to watch over a great treasure which is below in the tower,

3	

3	3	and they can have no rest until it is taken away, and I have likewise

3	

3	3	learnt, from their discourse, how that is to be done.’ Then all who

3	

3	3	heard this rejoiced, and the lord of the castle said he would adopt him

3	

3	3	as a son if he accomplished it successfully. He went down again, and

3	

3	3	as he knew what he had to do, he did it thoroughly, and brought a chest

3	

3	3	full of gold out with him. The howling of the wild dogs was henceforth

3	

3	3	heard no more; they had disappeared, and the country was freed from the

3	

3	3	trouble.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	After some time he took it in his head that he would travel to Rome. On

3	

3	3	the way he passed by a marsh, in which a number of frogs were sitting

3	

3	3	croaking. He listened to them, and when he became aware of what they

3	

3	3	were saying, he grew very thoughtful and sad. At last he arrived in

3	

3	3	Rome, where the Pope had just died, and there was great doubt among

3	

3	3	the cardinals as to whom they should appoint as his successor. They at

3	

3	3	length agreed that the person should be chosen as pope who should be

3	

3	3	distinguished by some divine and miraculous token. And just as that was

3	

3	3	decided on, the young count entered into the church, and suddenly two

3	

3	3	snow-white doves flew on his shoulders and remained sitting there. The

3	

3	3	ecclesiastics recognized therein the token from above, and asked him on

3	

3	3	the spot if he would be pope. He was undecided, and knew not if he were

3	

3	3	worthy of this, but the doves counselled him to do it, and at length he

3	

3	3	said yes. Then was he anointed and consecrated, and thus was fulfilled

3	

3	3	what he had heard from the frogs on his way, which had so affected him,

3	

3	3	that he was to be his Holiness the Pope. Then he had to sing a mass, and

3	

3	3	did not know one word of it, but the two doves sat continually on his

3	

3	3	shoulders, and said it all in his ear.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	THE FOX AND THE CAT

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to

3	

3	3	herself: ‘He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the

3	

3	3	world,’ she spoke to him in a friendly way. ‘Good day, dear Mr Fox,

3	

3	3	how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard

3	

3	3	times?’ The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from

3	

3	3	head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give

3	

3	3	any answer or not. At last he said: ‘Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you

3	

3	3	piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have

3	

3	3	you the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How

3	

3	3	many arts do you understand?’ ‘I understand but one,’ replied the

3	

3	3	cat, modestly. ‘What art is that?’ asked the fox. ‘When the hounds are

3	

3	3	following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.’ ‘Is that all?’

3	

3	3	said the fox. ‘I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain

3	

3	3	a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will

3	

3	3	teach you how people get away from the hounds.’ Just then came a hunter

3	

3	3	with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top

3	

3	3	of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. ‘Open your

3	

3	3	sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,’ cried the cat to him, but the dogs had

3	

3	3	already seized him, and were holding him fast. ‘Ah, Mr Fox,’ cried the

3	

3	3	cat. ‘You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been

3	

3	3	able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	THE FOUR CLEVER BROTHERS

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Dear children,’ said a poor man to his four sons, ‘I have nothing to

3	

3	3	give you; you must go out into the wide world and try your luck. Begin

3	

3	3	by learning some craft or another, and see how you can get on.’ So the

3	

3	3	four brothers took their walking-sticks in their hands, and their little

3	

3	3	bundles on their shoulders, and after bidding their father goodbye, went

3	

3	3	all out at the gate together. When they had got on some way they came

3	

3	3	to four crossways, each leading to a different country. Then the eldest

3	

3	3	said, ‘Here we must part; but this day four years we will come back

3	

3	3	to this spot, and in the meantime each must try what he can do for

3	

3	3	himself.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	So each brother went his way; and as the eldest was hastening on a man

3	

3	3	met him, and asked him where he was going, and what he wanted. ‘I am

3	

3	3	going to try my luck in the world, and should like to begin by learning

3	

3	3	some art or trade,’ answered he. ‘Then,’ said the man, ‘go with me, and

3	

3	3	I will teach you to become the cunningest thief that ever was.’ ‘No,’

3	

3	3	said the other, ‘that is not an honest calling, and what can one look

3	

3	3	to earn by it in the end but the gallows?’ ‘Oh!’ said the man, ‘you need

3	

3	3	not fear the gallows; for I will only teach you to steal what will be

3	

3	3	fair game: I meddle with nothing but what no one else can get or care

3	

3	3	anything about, and where no one can find you out.’ So the young man

3	

3	3	agreed to follow his trade, and he soon showed himself so clever, that

3	

3	3	nothing could escape him that he had once set his mind upon.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The second brother also met a man, who, when he found out what he was

3	

3	3	setting out upon, asked him what craft he meant to follow. ‘I do not

3	

3	3	know yet,’ said he. ‘Then come with me, and be a star-gazer. It is a

3	

3	3	noble art, for nothing can be hidden from you, when once you understand

3	

3	3	the stars.’ The plan pleased him much, and he soon became such a skilful

3	

3	3	star-gazer, that when he had served out his time, and wanted to leave

3	

3	3	his master, he gave him a glass, and said, ‘With this you can see all

3	

3	3	that is passing in the sky and on earth, and nothing can be hidden from

3	

3	3	you.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The third brother met a huntsman, who took him with him, and taught him

3	

3	3	so well all that belonged to hunting, that he became very clever in the

3	

3	3	craft of the woods; and when he left his master he gave him a bow, and

3	

3	3	said, ‘Whatever you shoot at with this bow you will be sure to hit.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The youngest brother likewise met a man who asked him what he wished to

3	

3	3	do. ‘Would not you like,’ said he, ‘to be a tailor?’ ‘Oh, no!’ said

3	

3	3	the young man; ‘sitting cross-legged from morning to night, working

3	

3	3	backwards and forwards with a needle and goose, will never suit me.’

3	

3	3	‘Oh!’ answered the man, ‘that is not my sort of tailoring; come with me,

3	

3	3	and you will learn quite another kind of craft from that.’ Not knowing

3	

3	3	what better to do, he came into the plan, and learnt tailoring from the

3	

3	3	beginning; and when he left his master, he gave him a needle, and said,

3	

3	3	‘You can sew anything with this, be it as soft as an egg or as hard as

3	

3	3	steel; and the joint will be so fine that no seam will be seen.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	After the space of four years, at the time agreed upon, the four

3	

3	3	brothers met at the four cross-roads; and having welcomed each other,

3	

3	3	set off towards their father’s home, where they told him all that had

3	

3	3	happened to them, and how each had learned some craft.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then, one day, as they were sitting before the house under a very high

3	

3	3	tree, the father said, ‘I should like to try what each of you can do in

3	

3	3	this way.’ So he looked up, and said to the second son, ‘At the top of

3	

3	3	this tree there is a chaffinch’s nest; tell me how many eggs there are

3	

3	3	in it.’ The star-gazer took his glass, looked up, and said, ‘Five.’

3	

3	3	‘Now,’ said the father to the eldest son, ‘take away the eggs without

3	

3	3	letting the bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them know

3	

3	3	anything of what you are doing.’ So the cunning thief climbed up the

3	

3	3	tree, and brought away to his father the five eggs from under the bird;

3	

3	3	and it never saw or felt what he was doing, but kept sitting on at its

3	

3	3	ease. Then the father took the eggs, and put one on each corner of the

3	

3	3	table, and the fifth in the middle, and said to the huntsman, ‘Cut all

3	

3	3	the eggs in two pieces at one shot.’ The huntsman took up his bow, and

3	

3	3	at one shot struck all the five eggs as his father wished.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Now comes your turn,’ said he to the young tailor; ‘sew the eggs and

3	

3	3	the young birds in them together again, so neatly that the shot shall

3	

3	3	have done them no harm.’ Then the tailor took his needle, and sewed the

3	

3	3	eggs as he was told; and when he had done, the thief was sent to take

3	

3	3	them back to the nest, and put them under the bird without its knowing

3	

3	3	it. Then she went on sitting, and hatched them: and in a few days they

3	

3	3	crawled out, and had only a little red streak across their necks, where

3	

3	3	the tailor had sewn them together.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Well done, sons!’ said the old man; ‘you have made good use of your

3	

3	3	time, and learnt something worth the knowing; but I am sure I do not

3	

3	3	know which ought to have the prize. Oh, that a time might soon come for

3	

3	3	you to turn your skill to some account!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Not long after this there was a great bustle in the country; for the

3	

3	3	king’s daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon, and the king

3	

3	3	mourned over his loss day and night, and made it known that whoever

3	

3	3	brought her back to him should have her for a wife. Then the four

3	

3	3	brothers said to each other, ‘Here is a chance for us; let us try

3	

3	3	what we can do.’ And they agreed to see whether they could not set the

3	

3	3	princess free. ‘I will soon find out where she is, however,’ said the

3	

3	3	star-gazer, as he looked through his glass; and he soon cried out, ‘I

3	

3	3	see her afar off, sitting upon a rock in the sea, and I can spy the

3	

3	3	dragon close by, guarding her.’ Then he went to the king, and asked for

3	

3	3	a ship for himself and his brothers; and they sailed together over the

3	

3	3	sea, till they came to the right place. There they found the princess

3	

3	3	sitting, as the star-gazer had said, on the rock; and the dragon was

3	

3	3	lying asleep, with his head upon her lap. ‘I dare not shoot at him,’

3	

3	3	said the huntsman, ‘for I should kill the beautiful young lady also.’

3	

3	3	‘Then I will try my skill,’ said the thief, and went and stole her away

3	

3	3	from under the dragon, so quietly and gently that the beast did not know

3	

3	3	it, but went on snoring.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then away they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards the

3	

3	3	ship; but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the air; for

3	

3	3	he awoke and missed the princess. But when he got over the boat, and

3	

3	3	wanted to pounce upon them and carry off the princess, the huntsman took

3	

3	3	up his bow and shot him straight through the heart so that he fell down

3	

3	3	dead. They were still not safe; for he was such a great beast that in

3	

3	3	his fall he overset the boat, and they had to swim in the open sea

3	

3	3	upon a few planks. So the tailor took his needle, and with a few large

3	

3	3	stitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these,

3	

3	3	and sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked

3	

3	3	them together so quickly that the boat was soon ready, and they then

3	

3	3	reached the ship and got home safe.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When they had brought home the princess to her father, there was great

3	

3	3	rejoicing; and he said to the four brothers, ‘One of you shall marry

3	

3	3	her, but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be.’ Then

3	

3	3	there arose a quarrel between them; and the star-gazer said, ‘If I had

3	

3	3	not found the princess out, all your skill would have been of no use;

3	

3	3	therefore she ought to be mine.’ ‘Your seeing her would have been of

3	

3	3	no use,’ said the thief, ‘if I had not taken her away from the dragon;

3	

3	3	therefore she ought to be mine.’ ‘No, she is mine,’ said the huntsman;

3	

3	3	‘for if I had not killed the dragon, he would, after all, have torn you

3	

3	3	and the princess into pieces.’ ‘And if I had not sewn the boat together

3	

3	3	again,’ said the tailor, ‘you would all have been drowned, therefore she

3	

3	3	is mine.’ Then the king put in a word, and said, ‘Each of you is right;

3	

3	3	and as all cannot have the young lady, the best way is for neither of

3	

3	3	you to have her: for the truth is, there is somebody she likes a great

3	

3	3	deal better. But to make up for your loss, I will give each of you, as a

3	

3	3	reward for his skill, half a kingdom.’ So the brothers agreed that this

3	

3	3	plan would be much better than either quarrelling or marrying a lady who

3	

3	3	had no mind to have them. And the king then gave to each half a kingdom,

3	

3	3	as he had said; and they lived very happily the rest of their days, and

3	

3	3	took good care of their father; and somebody took better care of the

3	

3	3	young lady, than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have

3	

3	3	her again.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	LILY AND THE LION

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	A merchant, who had three daughters, was once setting out upon a

3	

3	3	journey; but before he went he asked each daughter what gift he should

3	

3	3	bring back for her. The eldest wished for pearls; the second for jewels;

3	

3	3	but the third, who was called Lily, said, ‘Dear father, bring me a

3	

3	3	rose.’ Now it was no easy task to find a rose, for it was the middle

3	

3	3	of winter; yet as she was his prettiest daughter, and was very fond of

3	

3	3	flowers, her father said he would try what he could do. So he kissed all

3	

3	3	three, and bid them goodbye.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And when the time came for him to go home, he had bought pearls and

3	

3	3	jewels for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain for the

3	

3	3	rose; and when he went into any garden and asked for such a thing, the

3	

3	3	people laughed at him, and asked him whether he thought roses grew in

3	

3	3	snow. This grieved him very much, for Lily was his dearest child; and as

3	

3	3	he was journeying home, thinking what he should bring her, he came to a

3	

3	3	fine castle; and around the castle was a garden, in one half of which it

3	

3	3	seemed to be summer-time and in the other half winter. On one side the

3	

3	3	finest flowers were in full bloom, and on the other everything looked

3	

3	3	dreary and buried in the snow. ‘A lucky hit!’ said he, as he called to

3	

3	3	his servant, and told him to go to a beautiful bed of roses that was

3	

3	3	there, and bring him away one of the finest flowers.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	This done, they were riding away well pleased, when up sprang a fierce

3	

3	3	lion, and roared out, ‘Whoever has stolen my roses shall be eaten up

3	

3	3	alive!’ Then the man said, ‘I knew not that the garden belonged to you;

3	

3	3	can nothing save my life?’ ‘No!’ said the lion, ‘nothing, unless you

3	

3	3	undertake to give me whatever meets you on your return home; if you

3	

3	3	agree to this, I will give you your life, and the rose too for your

3	

3	3	daughter.’ But the man was unwilling to do so and said, ‘It may be my

3	

3	3	youngest daughter, who loves me most, and always runs to meet me when

3	

3	3	I go home.’ Then the servant was greatly frightened, and said, ‘It may

3	

3	3	perhaps be only a cat or a dog.’ And at last the man yielded with a

3	

3	3	heavy heart, and took the rose; and said he would give the lion whatever

3	

3	3	should meet him first on his return.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And as he came near home, it was Lily, his youngest and dearest

3	

3	3	daughter, that met him; she came running, and kissed him, and welcomed

3	

3	3	him home; and when she saw that he had brought her the rose, she was

3	

3	3	still more glad. But her father began to be very sorrowful, and to weep,

3	

3	3	saying, ‘Alas, my dearest child! I have bought this flower at a high

3	

3	3	price, for I have said I would give you to a wild lion; and when he has

3	

3	3	you, he will tear you in pieces, and eat you.’ Then he told her all that

3	

3	3	had happened, and said she should not go, let what would happen.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But she comforted him, and said, ‘Dear father, the word you have given

3	

3	3	must be kept; I will go to the lion, and soothe him: perhaps he will let

3	

3	3	me come safe home again.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The next morning she asked the way she was to go, and took leave of her

3	

3	3	father, and went forth with a bold heart into the wood. But the lion was

3	

3	3	an enchanted prince. By day he and all his court were lions, but in the

3	

3	3	evening they took their right forms again. And when Lily came to the

3	

3	3	castle, he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him. The

3	

3	3	wedding-feast was held, and they lived happily together a long time. The

3	

3	3	prince was only to be seen as soon as evening came, and then he held his

3	

3	3	court; but every morning he left his bride, and went away by himself,

3	

3	3	she knew not whither, till the night came again.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	After some time he said to her, ‘Tomorrow there will be a great feast in

3	

3	3	your father’s house, for your eldest sister is to be married; and if

3	

3	3	you wish to go and visit her my lions shall lead you thither.’ Then she

3	

3	3	rejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more, and set

3	

3	3	out with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see her, for they had

3	

3	3	thought her dead long since. But she told them how happy she was, and

3	

3	3	stayed till the feast was over, and then went back to the wood.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Her second sister was soon after married, and when Lily was asked to

3	

3	3	go to the wedding, she said to the prince, ‘I will not go alone this

3	

3	3	time--you must go with me.’ But he would not, and said that it would be

3	

3	3	a very hazardous thing; for if the least ray of the torch-light should

3	

3	3	fall upon him his enchantment would become still worse, for he should be

3	

3	3	changed into a dove, and be forced to wander about the world for seven

3	

3	3	long years. However, she gave him no rest, and said she would take care

3	

3	3	no light should fall upon him. So at last they set out together, and

3	

3	3	took with them their little child; and she chose a large hall with thick

3	

3	3	walls for him to sit in while the wedding-torches were lighted; but,

3	

3	3	unluckily, no one saw that there was a crack in the door. Then the

3	

3	3	wedding was held with great pomp, but as the train came from the church,

3	

3	3	and passed with the torches before the hall, a very small ray of light

3	

3	3	fell upon the prince. In a moment he disappeared, and when his wife came

3	

3	3	in and looked for him, she found only a white dove; and it said to her,

3	

3	3	‘Seven years must I fly up and down over the face of the earth, but

3	

3	3	every now and then I will let fall a white feather, that will show you

3	

3	3	the way I am going; follow it, and at last you may overtake and set me

3	

3	3	free.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	This said, he flew out at the door, and poor Lily followed; and every

3	

3	3	now and then a white feather fell, and showed her the way she was to

3	

3	3	journey. Thus she went roving on through the wide world, and looked

3	

3	3	neither to the right hand nor to the left, nor took any rest, for seven

3	

3	3	years. Then she began to be glad, and thought to herself that the time

3	

3	3	was fast coming when all her troubles should end; yet repose was still

3	

3	3	far off, for one day as she was travelling on she missed the white

3	

3	3	feather, and when she lifted up her eyes she could nowhere see the dove.

3	

3	3	‘Now,’ thought she to herself, ‘no aid of man can be of use to me.’ So

3	

3	3	she went to the sun and said, ‘Thou shinest everywhere, on the hill’s

3	

3	3	top and the valley’s depth--hast thou anywhere seen my white dove?’

3	

3	3	‘No,’ said the sun, ‘I have not seen it; but I will give thee a

3	

3	3	casket--open it when thy hour of need comes.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	So she thanked the sun, and went on her way till eventide; and when

3	

3	3	the moon arose, she cried unto it, and said, ‘Thou shinest through the

3	

3	3	night, over field and grove--hast thou nowhere seen my white dove?’

3	

3	3	‘No,’ said the moon, ‘I cannot help thee but I will give thee an

3	

3	3	egg--break it when need comes.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then she thanked the moon, and went on till the night-wind blew; and she

3	

3	3	raised up her voice to it, and said, ‘Thou blowest through every tree

3	

3	3	and under every leaf--hast thou not seen my white dove?’ ‘No,’ said the

3	

3	3	night-wind, ‘but I will ask three other winds; perhaps they have seen

3	

3	3	it.’ Then the east wind and the west wind came, and said they too had

3	

3	3	not seen it, but the south wind said, ‘I have seen the white dove--he

3	

3	3	has fled to the Red Sea, and is changed once more into a lion, for the

3	

3	3	seven years are passed away, and there he is fighting with a dragon;

3	

3	3	and the dragon is an enchanted princess, who seeks to separate him from

3	

3	3	you.’ Then the night-wind said, ‘I will give thee counsel. Go to the

3	

3	3	Red Sea; on the right shore stand many rods--count them, and when thou

3	

3	3	comest to the eleventh, break it off, and smite the dragon with it; and

3	

3	3	so the lion will have the victory, and both of them will appear to you

3	

3	3	in their own forms. Then look round and thou wilt see a griffin, winged

3	

3	3	like bird, sitting by the Red Sea; jump on to his back with thy beloved

3	

3	3	one as quickly as possible, and he will carry you over the waters to

3	

3	3	your home. I will also give thee this nut,’ continued the night-wind.

3	

3	3	‘When you are half-way over, throw it down, and out of the waters will

3	

3	3	immediately spring up a high nut-tree on which the griffin will be able

3	

3	3	to rest, otherwise he would not have the strength to bear you the whole

3	

3	3	way; if, therefore, thou dost forget to throw down the nut, he will let

3	

3	3	you both fall into the sea.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	So our poor wanderer went forth, and found all as the night-wind had

3	

3	3	said; and she plucked the eleventh rod, and smote the dragon, and the

3	

3	3	lion forthwith became a prince, and the dragon a princess again. But

3	

3	3	no sooner was the princess released from the spell, than she seized

3	

3	3	the prince by the arm and sprang on to the griffin’s back, and went off

3	

3	3	carrying the prince away with her.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Thus the unhappy traveller was again forsaken and forlorn; but she

3	

3	3	took heart and said, ‘As far as the wind blows, and so long as the cock

3	

3	3	crows, I will journey on, till I find him once again.’ She went on for

3	

3	3	a long, long way, till at length she came to the castle whither the

3	

3	3	princess had carried the prince; and there was a feast got ready, and

3	

3	3	she heard that the wedding was about to be held. ‘Heaven aid me now!’

3	

3	3	said she; and she took the casket that the sun had given her, and found

3	

3	3	that within it lay a dress as dazzling as the sun itself. So she put it

3	

3	3	on, and went into the palace, and all the people gazed upon her; and

3	

3	3	the dress pleased the bride so much that she asked whether it was to be

3	

3	3	sold. ‘Not for gold and silver.’ said she, ‘but for flesh and blood.’

3	

3	3	The princess asked what she meant, and she said, ‘Let me speak with the

3	

3	3	bridegroom this night in his chamber, and I will give thee the dress.’

3	

3	3	At last the princess agreed, but she told her chamberlain to give the

3	

3	3	prince a sleeping draught, that he might not hear or see her. When

3	

3	3	evening came, and the prince had fallen asleep, she was led into

3	

3	3	his chamber, and she sat herself down at his feet, and said: ‘I have

3	

3	3	followed thee seven years. I have been to the sun, the moon, and the

3	

3	3	night-wind, to seek thee, and at last I have helped thee to overcome

3	

3	3	the dragon. Wilt thou then forget me quite?’ But the prince all the time

3	

3	3	slept so soundly, that her voice only passed over him, and seemed like

3	

3	3	the whistling of the wind among the fir-trees.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then poor Lily was led away, and forced to give up the golden dress; and

3	

3	3	when she saw that there was no help for her, she went out into a meadow,

3	

3	3	and sat herself down and wept. But as she sat she bethought herself of

3	

3	3	the egg that the moon had given her; and when she broke it, there ran

3	

3	3	out a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold, that played about, and then

3	

3	3	nestled under the old one’s wings, so as to form the most beautiful

3	

3	3	sight in the world. And she rose up and drove them before her, till the

3	

3	3	bride saw them from her window, and was so pleased that she came forth

3	

3	3	and asked her if she would sell the brood. ‘Not for gold or silver, but

3	

3	3	for flesh and blood: let me again this evening speak with the bridegroom

3	

3	3	in his chamber, and I will give thee the whole brood.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the princess thought to betray her as before, and agreed to

3	

3	3	what she asked: but when the prince went to his chamber he asked

3	

3	3	the chamberlain why the wind had whistled so in the night. And the

3	

3	3	chamberlain told him all--how he had given him a sleeping draught, and

3	

3	3	how a poor maiden had come and spoken to him in his chamber, and was

3	

3	3	to come again that night. Then the prince took care to throw away the

3	

3	3	sleeping draught; and when Lily came and began again to tell him what

3	

3	3	woes had befallen her, and how faithful and true to him she had been,

3	

3	3	he knew his beloved wife’s voice, and sprang up, and said, ‘You have

3	

3	3	awakened me as from a dream, for the strange princess had thrown a spell

3	

3	3	around me, so that I had altogether forgotten you; but Heaven hath sent

3	

3	3	you to me in a lucky hour.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And they stole away out of the palace by night unawares, and seated

3	

3	3	themselves on the griffin, who flew back with them over the Red Sea.

3	

3	3	When they were half-way across Lily let the nut fall into the water,

3	

3	3	and immediately a large nut-tree arose from the sea, whereon the griffin

3	

3	3	rested for a while, and then carried them safely home. There they found

3	

3	3	their child, now grown up to be comely and fair; and after all their

3	

3	3	troubles they lived happily together to the end of their days.

3	

3	3	THE FOX AND THE HORSE

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	A farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to

3	

3	3	him: but he was now grown too old to work; so the farmer would give him

3	

3	3	nothing more to eat, and said, ‘I want you no longer, so take yourself

3	

3	3	off out of my stable; I shall not take you back again until you are

3	

3	3	stronger than a lion.’ Then he opened the door and turned him adrift.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The poor horse was very melancholy, and wandered up and down in the

3	

3	3	wood, seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain. Presently

3	

3	3	a fox met him: ‘What’s the matter, my friend?’ said he, ‘why do you hang

3	

3	3	down your head and look so lonely and woe-begone?’ ‘Ah!’ replied the

3	

3	3	horse, ‘justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has

3	

3	3	forgotten all that I have done for him so many years, and because I

3	

3	3	can no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless I become

3	

3	3	stronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can I

3	

3	3	have of that? he knows I have none, or he would not talk so.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	However, the fox bid him be of good cheer, and said, ‘I will help you;

3	

3	3	lie down there, stretch yourself out quite stiff, and pretend to be

3	

3	3	dead.’ The horse did as he was told, and the fox went straight to the

3	

3	3	lion who lived in a cave close by, and said to him, ‘A little way off

3	

3	3	lies a dead horse; come with me and you may make an excellent meal of

3	

3	3	his carcase.’ The lion was greatly pleased, and set off immediately; and

3	

3	3	when they came to the horse, the fox said, ‘You will not be able to eat

3	

3	3	him comfortably here; I’ll tell you what--I will tie you fast to

3	

3	3	his tail, and then you can draw him to your den, and eat him at your

3	

3	3	leisure.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	This advice pleased the lion, so he laid himself down quietly for the

3	

3	3	fox to make him fast to the horse. But the fox managed to tie his legs

3	

3	3	together and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength he

3	

3	3	could not set himself free. When the work was done, the fox clapped the

3	

3	3	horse on the shoulder, and said, ‘Jip! Dobbin! Jip!’ Then up he sprang,

3	

3	3	and moved off, dragging the lion behind him. The beast began to roar

3	

3	3	and bellow, till all the birds of the wood flew away for fright; but the

3	

3	3	horse let him sing on, and made his way quietly over the fields to his

3	

3	3	master’s house.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Here he is, master,’ said he, ‘I have got the better of him’: and when

3	

3	3	the farmer saw his old servant, his heart relented, and he said. ‘Thou

3	

3	3	shalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of.’ And so the poor old

3	

3	3	horse had plenty to eat, and lived--till he died.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3

3	

3	3	THE BLUE LIGHT

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There was once upon a time a soldier who for many years had served the

3	

3	3	king faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no longer

3	

3	3	because of the many wounds which he had received. The king said to him:

3	

3	3	‘You may return to your home, I need you no longer, and you will not

3	

3	3	receive any more money, for he only receives wages who renders me

3	

3	3	service for them.’ Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living,

3	

3	3	went away greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the

3	

3	3	evening he entered a forest. When darkness came on, he saw a light,

3	

3	3	which he went up to, and came to a house wherein lived a witch. ‘Do give

3	

3	3	me one night’s lodging, and a little to eat and drink,’ said he to

3	

3	3	her, ‘or I shall starve.’ ‘Oho!’ she answered, ‘who gives anything to a

3	

3	3	run-away soldier? Yet will I be compassionate, and take you in, if you

3	

3	3	will do what I wish.’ ‘What do you wish?’ said the soldier. ‘That you

3	

3	3	should dig all round my garden for me, tomorrow.’ The soldier consented,

3	

3	3	and next day laboured with all his strength, but could not finish it by

3	

3	3	the evening. ‘I see well enough,’ said the witch, ‘that you can do no

3	

3	3	more today, but I will keep you yet another night, in payment for

3	

3	3	which you must tomorrow chop me a load of wood, and chop it small.’ The

3	

3	3	soldier spent the whole day in doing it, and in the evening the witch

3	

3	3	proposed that he should stay one night more. ‘Tomorrow, you shall only

3	

3	3	do me a very trifling piece of work. Behind my house, there is an old

3	

3	3	dry well, into which my light has fallen, it burns blue, and never goes

3	

3	3	out, and you shall bring it up again.’ Next day the old woman took him

3	

3	3	to the well, and let him down in a basket. He found the blue light, and

3	

3	3	made her a signal to draw him up again. She did draw him up, but when he

3	

3	3	came near the edge, she stretched down her hand and wanted to take the

3	

3	3	blue light away from him. ‘No,’ said he, perceiving her evil intention,

3	

3	3	‘I will not give you the light until I am standing with both feet upon

3	

3	3	the ground.’ The witch fell into a passion, let him fall again into the

3	

3	3	well, and went away.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the blue

3	

3	3	light went on burning, but of what use was that to him? He saw very well

3	

3	3	that he could not escape death. He sat for a while very sorrowfully,

3	

3	3	then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which

3	

3	3	was still half full. ‘This shall be my last pleasure,’ thought he,

3	

3	3	pulled it out, lit it at the blue light and began to smoke. When the

3	

3	3	smoke had circled about the cavern, suddenly a little black dwarf stood

3	

3	3	before him, and said: ‘Lord, what are your commands?’ ‘What my commands

3	

3	3	are?’ replied the soldier, quite astonished. ‘I must do everything you

3	

3	3	bid me,’ said the little man. ‘Good,’ said the soldier; ‘then in the

3	

3	3	first place help me out of this well.’ The little man took him by the

3	

3	3	hand, and led him through an underground passage, but he did not forget

3	

3	3	to take the blue light with him. On the way the dwarf showed him the

3	

3	3	treasures which the witch had collected and hidden there, and the

3	

3	3	soldier took as much gold as he could carry. When he was above, he said

3	

3	3	to the little man: ‘Now go and bind the old witch, and carry her before

3	

3	3	the judge.’ In a short time she came by like the wind, riding on a wild

3	

3	3	tom-cat and screaming frightfully. Nor was it long before the little man

3	

3	3	reappeared. ‘It is all done,’ said he, ‘and the witch is already hanging

3	

3	3	on the gallows. What further commands has my lord?’ inquired the dwarf.

3	

3	3	‘At this moment, none,’ answered the soldier; ‘you can return home, only

3	

3	3	be at hand immediately, if I summon you.’ ‘Nothing more is needed than

3	

3	3	that you should light your pipe at the blue light, and I will appear

3	

3	3	before you at once.’ Thereupon he vanished from his sight.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The soldier returned to the town from which he came. He went to the

3	

3	3	best inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord

3	

3	3	furnish him a room as handsome as possible. When it was ready and the

3	

3	3	soldier had taken possession of it, he summoned the little black manikin

3	

3	3	and said: ‘I have served the king faithfully, but he has dismissed me,

3	

3	3	and left me to hunger, and now I want to take my revenge.’ ‘What am I to

3	

3	3	do?’ asked the little man. ‘Late at night, when the king’s daughter is

3	

3	3	in bed, bring her here in her sleep, she shall do servant’s work for

3	

3	3	me.’ The manikin said: ‘That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very

3	

3	3	dangerous thing for you, for if it is discovered, you will fare ill.’

3	

3	3	When twelve o’clock had struck, the door sprang open, and the manikin

3	

3	3	carried in the princess. ‘Aha! are you there?’ cried the soldier, ‘get

3	

3	3	to your work at once! Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber.’ When

3	

3	3	she had done this, he ordered her to come to his chair, and then he

3	

3	3	stretched out his feet and said: ‘Pull off my boots,’ and then he

3	

3	3	threw them in her face, and made her pick them up again, and clean

3	

3	3	and brighten them. She, however, did everything he bade her, without

3	

3	3	opposition, silently and with half-shut eyes. When the first cock

3	

3	3	crowed, the manikin carried her back to the royal palace, and laid her

3	

3	3	in her bed.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Next morning when the princess arose she went to her father, and told

3	

3	3	him that she had had a very strange dream. ‘I was carried through the

3	

3	3	streets with the rapidity of lightning,’ said she, ‘and taken into a

3	

3	3	soldier’s room, and I had to wait upon him like a servant, sweep his

3	

3	3	room, clean his boots, and do all kinds of menial work. It was only a

3	

3	3	dream, and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done everything.’

3	

3	3	‘The dream may have been true,’ said the king. ‘I will give you a piece

3	

3	3	of advice. Fill your pocket full of peas, and make a small hole in the

3	

3	3	pocket, and then if you are carried away again, they will fall out and

3	

3	3	leave a track in the streets.’ But unseen by the king, the manikin was

3	

3	3	standing beside him when he said that, and heard all. At night when

3	

3	3	the sleeping princess was again carried through the streets, some peas

3	

3	3	certainly did fall out of her pocket, but they made no track, for the

3	

3	3	crafty manikin had just before scattered peas in every street there

3	

3	3	was. And again the princess was compelled to do servant’s work until

3	

3	3	cock-crow.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Next morning the king sent his people out to seek the track, but it was

3	

3	3	all in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting, picking up

3	

3	3	peas, and saying: ‘It must have rained peas, last night.’ ‘We must think

3	

3	3	of something else,’ said the king; ‘keep your shoes on when you go to

3	

3	3	bed, and before you come back from the place where you are taken, hide

3	

3	3	one of them there, I will soon contrive to find it.’ The black manikin

3	

3	3	heard this plot, and at night when the soldier again ordered him to

3	

3	3	bring the princess, revealed it to him, and told him that he knew of no

3	

3	3	expedient to counteract this stratagem, and that if the shoe were found

3	

3	3	in the soldier’s house it would go badly with him. ‘Do what I bid you,’

3	

3	3	replied the soldier, and again this third night the princess was obliged

3	

3	3	to work like a servant, but before she went away, she hid her shoe under

3	

3	3	the bed.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Next morning the king had the entire town searched for his daughter’s

3	

3	3	shoe. It was found at the soldier’s, and the soldier himself, who at the

3	

3	3	entreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate, was soon brought back,

3	

3	3	and thrown into prison. In his flight he had forgotten the most valuable

3	

3	3	things he had, the blue light and the gold, and had only one ducat in

3	

3	3	his pocket. And now loaded with chains, he was standing at the window of

3	

3	3	his dungeon, when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by. The

3	

3	3	soldier tapped at the pane of glass, and when this man came up, said to

3	

3	3	him: ‘Be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle I have left lying in

3	

3	3	the inn, and I will give you a ducat for doing it.’ His comrade ran

3	

3	3	thither and brought him what he wanted. As soon as the soldier was alone

3	

3	3	again, he lighted his pipe and summoned the black manikin. ‘Have no

3	

3	3	fear,’ said the latter to his master. ‘Go wheresoever they take you, and

3	

3	3	let them do what they will, only take the blue light with you.’ Next day

3	

3	3	the soldier was tried, and though he had done nothing wicked, the judge

3	

3	3	condemned him to death. When he was led forth to die, he begged a last

3	

3	3	favour of the king. ‘What is it?’ asked the king. ‘That I may smoke one

3	

3	3	more pipe on my way.’ ‘You may smoke three,’ answered the king, ‘but do

3	

3	3	not imagine that I will spare your life.’ Then the soldier pulled out

3	

3	3	his pipe and lighted it at the blue light, and as soon as a few wreaths

3	

3	3	of smoke had ascended, the manikin was there with a small cudgel in his

3	

3	3	hand, and said: ‘What does my lord command?’ ‘Strike down to earth that

3	

3	3	false judge there, and his constable, and spare not the king who has

3	

3	3	treated me so ill.’ Then the manikin fell on them like lightning,

3	

3	3	darting this way and that way, and whosoever was so much as touched by

3	

3	3	his cudgel fell to earth, and did not venture to stir again. The king

3	

3	3	was terrified; he threw himself on the soldier’s mercy, and merely to

3	

3	3	be allowed to live at all, gave him his kingdom for his own, and his

3	

3	3	daughter to wife.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	THE RAVEN

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There was once a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run

3	

3	3	alone. One day the child was very troublesome, and the mother could not

3	

3	3	quiet it, do what she would. She grew impatient, and seeing the ravens

3	

3	3	flying round the castle, she opened the window, and said: ‘I wish you

3	

3	3	were a raven and would fly away, then I should have a little peace.’

3	

3	3	Scarcely were the words out of her mouth, when the child in her arms was

3	

3	3	turned into a raven, and flew away from her through the open window. The

3	

3	3	bird took its flight to a dark wood and remained there for a long time,

3	

3	3	and meanwhile the parents could hear nothing of their child.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Long after this, a man was making his way through the wood when he heard

3	

3	3	a raven calling, and he followed the sound of the voice. As he drew

3	

3	3	near, the raven said, ‘I am by birth a king’s daughter, but am now under

3	

3	3	the spell of some enchantment; you can, however, set me free.’ ‘What

3	

3	3	am I to do?’ he asked. She replied, ‘Go farther into the wood until you

3	

3	3	come to a house, wherein lives an old woman; she will offer you food and

3	

3	3	drink, but you must not take of either; if you do, you will fall into

3	

3	3	a deep sleep, and will not be able to help me. In the garden behind the

3	

3	3	house is a large tan-heap, and on that you must stand and watch for me.

3	

3	3	I shall drive there in my carriage at two o’clock in the afternoon for

3	

3	3	three successive days; the first day it will be drawn by four white, the

3	

3	3	second by four chestnut, and the last by four black horses; but if you

3	

3	3	fail to keep awake and I find you sleeping, I shall not be set free.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The man promised to do all that she wished, but the raven said, ‘Alas! I

3	

3	3	know even now that you will take something from the woman and be unable

3	

3	3	to save me.’ The man assured her again that he would on no account touch

3	

3	3	a thing to eat or drink.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When he came to the house and went inside, the old woman met him, and

3	

3	3	said, ‘Poor man! how tired you are! Come in and rest and let me give you

3	

3	3	something to eat and drink.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘No,’ answered the man, ‘I will neither eat not drink.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But she would not leave him alone, and urged him saying, ‘If you will

3	

3	3	not eat anything, at least you might take a draught of wine; one drink

3	

3	3	counts for nothing,’ and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded, and

3	

3	3	drank.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	As it drew towards the appointed hour, he went outside into the garden

3	

3	3	and mounted the tan-heap to await the raven. Suddenly a feeling of

3	

3	3	fatigue came over him, and unable to resist it, he lay down for a little

3	

3	3	while, fully determined, however, to keep awake; but in another minute

3	

3	3	his eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell into such a deep sleep,

3	

3	3	that all the noises in the world would not have awakened him. At two

3	

3	3	o’clock the raven came driving along, drawn by her four white horses;

3	

3	3	but even before she reached the spot, she said to herself, sighing, ‘I

3	

3	3	know he has fallen asleep.’ When she entered the garden, there she found

3	

3	3	him as she had feared, lying on the tan-heap, fast asleep. She got out

3	

3	3	of her carriage and went to him; she called him and shook him, but it

3	

3	3	was all in vain, he still continued sleeping.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The next day at noon, the old woman came to him again with food and

3	

3	3	drink which he at first refused. At last, overcome by her persistent

3	

3	3	entreaties that he would take something, he lifted the glass and drank

3	

3	3	again.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Towards two o’clock he went into the garden and on to the tan-heap to

3	

3	3	watch for the raven. He had not been there long before he began to feel

3	

3	3	so tired that his limbs seemed hardly able to support him, and he could

3	

3	3	not stand upright any longer; so again he lay down and fell fast asleep.

3	

3	3	As the raven drove along her four chestnut horses, she said sorrowfully

3	

3	3	to herself, ‘I know he has fallen asleep.’ She went as before to look

3	

3	3	for him, but he slept, and it was impossible to awaken him.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The following day the old woman said to him, ‘What is this? You are not

3	

3	3	eating or drinking anything, do you want to kill yourself?’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	He answered, ‘I may not and will not either eat or drink.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But she put down the dish of food and the glass of wine in front of him,

3	

3	3	and when he smelt the wine, he was unable to resist the temptation, and

3	

3	3	took a deep draught.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When the hour came round again he went as usual on to the tan-heap in

3	

3	3	the garden to await the king’s daughter, but he felt even more overcome

3	

3	3	with weariness than on the two previous days, and throwing himself down,

3	

3	3	he slept like a log. At two o’clock the raven could be seen approaching,

3	

3	3	and this time her coachman and everything about her, as well as her

3	

3	3	horses, were black.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	She was sadder than ever as she drove along, and said mournfully, ‘I

3	

3	3	know he has fallen asleep, and will not be able to set me free.’ She

3	

3	3	found him sleeping heavily, and all her efforts to awaken him were of no

3	

3	3	avail. Then she placed beside him a loaf, and some meat, and a flask

3	

3	3	of wine, of such a kind, that however much he took of them, they would

3	

3	3	never grow less. After that she drew a gold ring, on which her name was

3	

3	3	engraved, off her finger, and put it upon one of his. Finally, she laid

3	

3	3	a letter near him, in which, after giving him particulars of the food

3	

3	3	and drink she had left for him, she finished with the following words:

3	

3	3	‘I see that as long as you remain here you will never be able to set me

3	

3	3	free; if, however, you still wish to do so, come to the golden castle

3	

3	3	of Stromberg; this is well within your power to accomplish.’ She then

3	

3	3	returned to her carriage and drove to the golden castle of Stromberg.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping, he was grieved

3	

3	3	at heart, and said, ‘She has no doubt been here and driven away again,

3	

3	3	and it is now too late for me to save her.’ Then his eyes fell on the

3	

3	3	things which were lying beside him; he read the letter, and knew from it

3	

3	3	all that had happened. He rose up without delay, eager to start on his

3	

3	3	way and to reach the castle of Stromberg, but he had no idea in which

3	

3	3	direction he ought to go. He travelled about a long time in search of it

3	

3	3	and came at last to a dark forest, through which he went on walking for

3	

3	3	fourteen days and still could not find a way out. Once more the night

3	

3	3	came on, and worn out he lay down under a bush and fell asleep. Again

3	

3	3	the next day he pursued his way through the forest, and that evening,

3	

3	3	thinking to rest again, he lay down as before, but he heard such a

3	

3	3	howling and wailing that he found it impossible to sleep. He waited till

3	

3	3	it was darker and people had begun to light up their houses, and then

3	

3	3	seeing a little glimmer ahead of him, he went towards it.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	He found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than

3	

3	3	it really was, from the contrast of its height with that of an immense

3	

3	3	giant who stood in front of it. He thought to himself, ‘If the giant

3	

3	3	sees me going in, my life will not be worth much.’ However, after a

3	

3	3	while he summoned up courage and went forward. When the giant saw him,

3	

3	3	he called out, ‘It is lucky for that you have come, for I have not had

3	

3	3	anything to eat for a long time. I can have you now for my supper.’ ‘I

3	

3	3	would rather you let that alone,’ said the man, ‘for I do not willingly

3	

3	3	give myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food I have enough to

3	

3	3	satisfy your hunger.’ ‘If that is so,’ replied the giant, ‘I will leave

3	

3	3	you in peace; I only thought of eating you because I had nothing else.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	So they went indoors together and sat down, and the man brought out the

3	

3	3	bread, meat, and wine, which although he had eaten and drunk of them,

3	

3	3	were still unconsumed. The giant was pleased with the good cheer, and

3	

3	3	ate and drank to his heart’s content. When he had finished his supper

3	

3	3	the man asked him if he could direct him to the castle of Stromberg.

3	

3	3	The giant said, ‘I will look on my map; on it are marked all the towns,

3	

3	3	villages, and houses.’ So he fetched his map, and looked for the castle,

3	

3	3	but could not find it. ‘Never mind,’ he said, ‘I have larger maps

3	

3	3	upstairs in the cupboard, we will look on those,’ but they searched in

3	

3	3	vain, for the castle was not marked even on these. The man now thought

3	

3	3	he should like to continue his journey, but the giant begged him to

3	

3	3	remain for a day or two longer until the return of his brother, who was

3	

3	3	away in search of provisions. When the brother came home, they asked him

3	

3	3	about the castle of Stromberg, and he told them he would look on his own

3	

3	3	maps as soon as he had eaten and appeased his hunger. Accordingly, when

3	

3	3	he had finished his supper, they all went up together to his room and

3	

3	3	looked through his maps, but the castle was not to be found. Then he

3	

3	3	fetched other older maps, and they went on looking for the castle until

3	

3	3	at last they found it, but it was many thousand miles away. ‘How shall I

3	

3	3	be able to get there?’ asked the man. ‘I have two hours to spare,’ said

3	

3	3	the giant, ‘and I will carry you into the neighbourhood of the castle; I

3	

3	3	must then return to look after the child who is in our care.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The giant, thereupon, carried the man to within about a hundred leagues

3	

3	3	of the castle, where he left him, saying, ‘You will be able to walk the

3	

3	3	remainder of the way yourself.’ The man journeyed on day and night

3	

3	3	till he reached the golden castle of Stromberg. He found it situated,

3	

3	3	however, on a glass mountain, and looking up from the foot he saw the

3	

3	3	enchanted maiden drive round her castle and then go inside. He was

3	

3	3	overjoyed to see her, and longed to get to the top of the mountain, but

3	

3	3	the sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climb he

3	

3	3	fell back again. When he saw that it was impossible to reach her, he was

3	

3	3	greatly grieved, and said to himself, ‘I will remain here and wait for

3	

3	3	her,’ so he built himself a little hut, and there he sat and watched for

3	

3	3	a whole year, and every day he saw the king’s daughter driving round her

3	

3	3	castle, but still was unable to get nearer to her.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Looking out from his hut one day he saw three robbers fighting and he

3	

3	3	called out to them, ‘God be with you.’ They stopped when they heard the

3	

3	3	call, but looking round and seeing nobody, they went on again with their

3	

3	3	fighting, which now became more furious. ‘God be with you,’ he cried

3	

3	3	again, and again they paused and looked about, but seeing no one went

3	

3	3	back to their fighting. A third time he called out, ‘God be with you,’

3	

3	3	and then thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute between

3	

3	3	the three men, he went out and asked them why they were fighting so

3	

3	3	angrily with one another. One of them said that he had found a stick,

3	

3	3	and that he had but to strike it against any door through which he

3	

3	3	wished to pass, and it immediately flew open. Another told him that he

3	

3	3	had found a cloak which rendered its wearer invisible; and the third had

3	

3	3	caught a horse which would carry its rider over any obstacle, and even

3	

3	3	up the glass mountain. They had been unable to decide whether they

3	

3	3	would keep together and have the things in common, or whether they would

3	

3	3	separate. On hearing this, the man said, ‘I will give you something in

3	

3	3	exchange for those three things; not money, for that I have not got,

3	

3	3	but something that is of far more value. I must first, however, prove

3	

3	3	whether all you have told me about your three things is true.’ The

3	

3	3	robbers, therefore, made him get on the horse, and handed him the stick

3	

3	3	and the cloak, and when he had put this round him he was no longer

3	

3	3	visible. Then he fell upon them with the stick and beat them one after

3	

3	3	another, crying, ‘There, you idle vagabonds, you have got what you

3	

3	3	deserve; are you satisfied now!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	After this he rode up the glass mountain. When he reached the gate of

3	

3	3	the castle, he found it closed, but he gave it a blow with his stick,

3	

3	3	and it flew wide open at once and he passed through. He mounted the

3	

3	3	steps and entered the room where the maiden was sitting, with a golden

3	

3	3	goblet full of wine in front of her. She could not see him for he still

3	

3	3	wore his cloak. He took the ring which she had given him off his finger,

3	

3	3	and threw it into the goblet, so that it rang as it touched the bottom.

3	

3	3	‘That is my own ring,’ she exclaimed, ‘and if that is so the man must

3	

3	3	also be here who is coming to set me free.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	She sought for him about the castle, but could find him nowhere.

3	

3	3	Meanwhile he had gone outside again and mounted his horse and thrown off

3	

3	3	the cloak. When therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him, and

3	

3	3	cried aloud for joy. Then he dismounted and took her in his arms; and

3	

3	3	she kissed him, and said, ‘Now you have indeed set me free, and tomorrow

3	

3	3	we will celebrate our marriage.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3

3	

3	3	THE GOLDEN GOOSE

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called

3	

3	3	Dummling,[*] and was despised, mocked, and sneered at on every occasion.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	It happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood,

3	

3	3	and before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a

3	

3	3	bottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When he entered the forest he met a little grey-haired old man who bade

3	

3	3	him good day, and said: ‘Do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket,

3	

3	3	and let me have a draught of your wine; I am so hungry and thirsty.’ But

3	

3	3	the clever son answered: ‘If I give you my cake and wine, I shall have

3	

3	3	none for myself; be off with you,’ and he left the little man standing

3	

3	3	and went on.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a

3	

3	3	false stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go home

3	

3	3	and have it bound up. And this was the little grey man’s doing.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	After this the second son went into the forest, and his mother gave him,

3	

3	3	like the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine. The little old grey man

3	

3	3	met him likewise, and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine.

3	

3	3	But the second son, too, said sensibly enough: ‘What I give you will be

3	

3	3	taken away from myself; be off!’ and he left the little man standing and

3	

3	3	went on. His punishment, however, was not delayed; when he had made a

3	

3	3	few blows at the tree he struck himself in the leg, so that he had to be

3	

3	3	carried home.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then Dummling said: ‘Father, do let me go and cut wood.’ The father

3	

3	3	answered: ‘Your brothers have hurt themselves with it, leave it alone,

3	

3	3	you do not understand anything about it.’ But Dummling begged so long

3	

3	3	that at last he said: ‘Just go then, you will get wiser by hurting

3	

3	3	yourself.’ His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the

3	

3	3	cinders, and with it a bottle of sour beer.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise,

3	

3	3	and greeting him, said: ‘Give me a piece of your cake and a drink out

3	

3	3	of your bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty.’ Dummling answered: ‘I have

3	

3	3	only cinder-cake and sour beer; if that pleases you, we will sit

3	

3	3	down and eat.’ So they sat down, and when Dummling pulled out his

3	

3	3	cinder-cake, it was a fine sweet cake, and the sour beer had become good

3	

3	3	wine. So they ate and drank, and after that the little man said: ‘Since

3	

3	3	you have a good heart, and are willing to divide what you have, I will

3	

3	3	give you good luck. There stands an old tree, cut it down, and you will

3	

3	3	find something at the roots.’ Then the little man took leave of him.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Dummling went and cut down the tree, and when it fell there was a goose

3	

3	3	sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. He lifted her up, and

3	

3	3	taking her with him, went to an inn where he thought he would stay the

3	

3	3	night. Now the host had three daughters, who saw the goose and were

3	

3	3	curious to know what such a wonderful bird might be, and would have

3	

3	3	liked to have one of its golden feathers.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The eldest thought: ‘I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a

3	

3	3	feather,’ and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by

3	

3	3	the wing, but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The second came soon afterwards, thinking only of how she might get a

3	

3	3	feather for herself, but she had scarcely touched her sister than she

3	

3	3	was held fast.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	At last the third also came with the like intent, and the others

3	

3	3	screamed out: ‘Keep away; for goodness’ sake keep away!’ But she did

3	

3	3	not understand why she was to keep away. ‘The others are there,’ she

3	

3	3	thought, ‘I may as well be there too,’ and ran to them; but as soon as

3	

3	3	she had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to her. So they

3	

3	3	had to spend the night with the goose.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set out,

3	

3	3	without troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to

3	

3	3	it. They were obliged to run after him continually, now left, now right,

3	

3	3	wherever his legs took him.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	In the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw the

3	

3	3	procession he said: ‘For shame, you good-for-nothing girls, why are you

3	

3	3	running across the fields after this young man? Is that seemly?’ At the

3	

3	3	same time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away,

3	

3	3	but as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast, and was himself

3	

3	3	obliged to run behind.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Before long the sexton came by and saw his master, the parson, running

3	

3	3	behind three girls. He was astonished at this and called out: ‘Hi!

3	

3	3	your reverence, whither away so quickly? Do not forget that we have a

3	

3	3	christening today!’ and running after him he took him by the sleeve, but

3	

3	3	was also held fast to it.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Whilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other, two labourers

3	

3	3	came with their hoes from the fields; the parson called out to them

3	

3	3	and begged that they would set him and the sexton free. But they had

3	

3	3	scarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast, and now there were

3	

3	3	seven of them running behind Dummling and the goose.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Soon afterwards he came to a city, where a king ruled who had a daughter

3	

3	3	who was so serious that no one could make her laugh. So he had put forth

3	

3	3	a decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marry

3	

3	3	her. When Dummling heard this, he went with his goose and all her train

3	

3	3	before the king’s daughter, and as soon as she saw the seven people

3	

3	3	running on and on, one behind the other, she began to laugh quite

3	

3	3	loudly, and as if she would never stop. Thereupon Dummling asked to have

3	

3	3	her for his wife; but the king did not like the son-in-law, and made all

3	

3	3	manner of excuses and said he must first produce a man who could drink

3	

3	3	a cellarful of wine. Dummling thought of the little grey man, who could

3	

3	3	certainly help him; so he went into the forest, and in the same place

3	

3	3	where he had felled the tree, he saw a man sitting, who had a very

3	

3	3	sorrowful face. Dummling asked him what he was taking to heart so

3	

3	3	sorely, and he answered: ‘I have such a great thirst and cannot quench

3	

3	3	it; cold water I cannot stand, a barrel of wine I have just emptied, but

3	

3	3	that to me is like a drop on a hot stone!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘There, I can help you,’ said Dummling, ‘just come with me and you shall

3	

3	3	be satisfied.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	He led him into the king’s cellar, and the man bent over the huge

3	

3	3	barrels, and drank and drank till his loins hurt, and before the day was

3	

3	3	out he had emptied all the barrels. Then Dummling asked once more

3	

3	3	for his bride, but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow, whom

3	

3	3	everyone called Dummling, should take away his daughter, and he made a

3	

3	3	new condition; he must first find a man who could eat a whole mountain

3	

3	3	of bread. Dummling did not think long, but went straight into the

3	

3	3	forest, where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his

3	

3	3	body with a strap, and making an awful face, and saying: ‘I have eaten a

3	

3	3	whole ovenful of rolls, but what good is that when one has such a hunger

3	

3	3	as I? My stomach remains empty, and I must tie myself up if I am not to

3	

3	3	die of hunger.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	At this Dummling was glad, and said: ‘Get up and come with me; you shall

3	

3	3	eat yourself full.’ He led him to the king’s palace where all the

3	

3	3	flour in the whole Kingdom was collected, and from it he caused a huge

3	

3	3	mountain of bread to be baked. The man from the forest stood before it,

3	

3	3	began to eat, and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished.

3	

3	3	Then Dummling for the third time asked for his bride; but the king again

3	

3	3	sought a way out, and ordered a ship which could sail on land and on

3	

3	3	water. ‘As soon as you come sailing back in it,’ said he, ‘you shall

3	

3	3	have my daughter for wife.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Dummling went straight into the forest, and there sat the little grey

3	

3	3	man to whom he had given his cake. When he heard what Dummling wanted,

3	

3	3	he said: ‘Since you have given me to eat and to drink, I will give you

3	

3	3	the ship; and I do all this because you once were kind to me.’ Then he

3	

3	3	gave him the ship which could sail on land and water, and when the king

3	

3	3	saw that, he could no longer prevent him from having his daughter. The

3	

3	3	wedding was celebrated, and after the king’s death, Dummling inherited

3	

3	3	his kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife.

3	

3	3	THE WATER OF LIFE

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Long before you or I were born, there reigned, in a country a great way

3	

3	3	off, a king who had three sons. This king once fell very ill--so ill

3	

3	3	that nobody thought he could live. His sons were very much grieved

3	

3	3	at their father’s sickness; and as they were walking together very

3	

3	3	mournfully in the garden of the palace, a little old man met them and

3	

3	3	asked what was the matter. They told him that their father was very ill,

3	

3	3	and that they were afraid nothing could save him. ‘I know what would,’

3	

3	3	said the little old man; ‘it is the Water of Life. If he could have a

3	

3	3	draught of it he would be well again; but it is very hard to get.’ Then

3	

3	3	the eldest son said, ‘I will soon find it’: and he went to the sick

3	

3	3	king, and begged that he might go in search of the Water of Life, as

3	

3	3	it was the only thing that could save him. ‘No,’ said the king. ‘I had

3	

3	3	rather die than place you in such great danger as you must meet with in

3	

3	3	your journey.’ But he begged so hard that the king let him go; and the

3	

3	3	prince thought to himself, ‘If I bring my father this water, he will

3	

3	3	make me sole heir to his kingdom.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then he set out: and when he had gone on his way some time he came to a

3	

3	3	deep valley, overhung with rocks and woods; and as he looked around, he

3	

3	3	saw standing above him on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf, with a

3	

3	3	sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak; and the dwarf called to him and said,

3	

3	3	‘Prince, whither so fast?’ ‘What is that to thee, you ugly imp?’ said

3	

3	3	the prince haughtily, and rode on.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell

3	

3	3	of ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became

3	

3	3	narrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he

3	

3	3	could not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his

3	

3	3	horse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing

3	

3	3	round him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so that he was

3	

3	3	shut in all round. He next tried to get off his horse and make his way

3	

3	3	on foot, but again the laugh rang in his ears, and he found himself

3	

3	3	unable to move a step, and thus he was forced to abide spellbound.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Meantime the old king was lingering on in daily hope of his son’s

3	

3	3	return, till at last the second son said, ‘Father, I will go in search

3	

3	3	of the Water of Life.’ For he thought to himself, ‘My brother is surely

3	

3	3	dead, and the kingdom will fall to me if I find the water.’ The king was

3	

3	3	at first very unwilling to let him go, but at last yielded to his wish.

3	

3	3	So he set out and followed the same road which his brother had done,

3	

3	3	and met with the same elf, who stopped him at the same spot in the

3	

3	3	mountains, saying, as before, ‘Prince, prince, whither so fast?’ ‘Mind

3	

3	3	your own affairs, busybody!’ said the prince scornfully, and rode on.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he put on his elder

3	

3	3	brother, and he, too, was at last obliged to take up his abode in the

3	

3	3	heart of the mountains. Thus it is with proud silly people, who think

3	

3	3	themselves above everyone else, and are too proud to ask or take advice.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When the second prince had thus been gone a long time, the youngest son

3	

3	3	said he would go and search for the Water of Life, and trusted he should

3	

3	3	soon be able to make his father well again. So he set out, and the dwarf

3	

3	3	met him too at the same spot in the valley, among the mountains, and

3	

3	3	said, ‘Prince, whither so fast?’ And the prince said, ‘I am going in

3	

3	3	search of the Water of Life, because my father is ill, and like to die:

3	

3	3	can you help me? Pray be kind, and aid me if you can!’ ‘Do you know

3	

3	3	where it is to be found?’ asked the dwarf. ‘No,’ said the prince, ‘I do

3	

3	3	not. Pray tell me if you know.’ ‘Then as you have spoken to me kindly,

3	

3	3	and are wise enough to seek for advice, I will tell you how and where to

3	

3	3	go. The water you seek springs from a well in an enchanted castle; and,

3	

3	3	that you may be able to reach it in safety, I will give you an iron wand

3	

3	3	and two little loaves of bread; strike the iron door of the castle three

3	

3	3	times with the wand, and it will open: two hungry lions will be lying

3	

3	3	down inside gaping for their prey, but if you throw them the bread they

3	

3	3	will let you pass; then hasten on to the well, and take some of the

3	

3	3	Water of Life before the clock strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer

3	

3	3	the door will shut upon you for ever.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the prince thanked his little friend with the scarlet cloak for his

3	

3	3	friendly aid, and took the wand and the bread, and went travelling on

3	

3	3	and on, over sea and over land, till he came to his journey’s end, and

3	

3	3	found everything to be as the dwarf had told him. The door flew open at

3	

3	3	the third stroke of the wand, and when the lions were quieted he went on

3	

3	3	through the castle and came at length to a beautiful hall. Around it he

3	

3	3	saw several knights sitting in a trance; then he pulled off their rings

3	

3	3	and put them on his own fingers. In another room he saw on a table a

3	

3	3	sword and a loaf of bread, which he also took. Further on he came to a

3	

3	3	room where a beautiful young lady sat upon a couch; and she welcomed him

3	

3	3	joyfully, and said, if he would set her free from the spell that bound

3	

3	3	her, the kingdom should be his, if he would come back in a year and

3	

3	3	marry her. Then she told him that the well that held the Water of Life

3	

3	3	was in the palace gardens; and bade him make haste, and draw what he

3	

3	3	wanted before the clock struck twelve.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	He walked on; and as he walked through beautiful gardens he came to a

3	

3	3	delightful shady spot in which stood a couch; and he thought to himself,

3	

3	3	as he felt tired, that he would rest himself for a while, and gaze on

3	

3	3	the lovely scenes around him. So he laid himself down, and sleep

3	

3	3	fell upon him unawares, so that he did not wake up till the clock was

3	

3	3	striking a quarter to twelve. Then he sprang from the couch dreadfully

3	

3	3	frightened, ran to the well, filled a cup that was standing by him full

3	

3	3	of water, and hastened to get away in time. Just as he was going out of

3	

3	3	the iron door it struck twelve, and the door fell so quickly upon him

3	

3	3	that it snapped off a piece of his heel.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When he found himself safe, he was overjoyed to think that he had got

3	

3	3	the Water of Life; and as he was going on his way homewards, he passed

3	

3	3	by the little dwarf, who, when he saw the sword and the loaf, said, ‘You

3	

3	3	have made a noble prize; with the sword you can at a blow slay whole

3	

3	3	armies, and the bread will never fail you.’ Then the prince thought

3	

3	3	to himself, ‘I cannot go home to my father without my brothers’; so he

3	

3	3	said, ‘My dear friend, cannot you tell me where my two brothers are, who

3	

3	3	set out in search of the Water of Life before me, and never came back?’

3	

3	3	‘I have shut them up by a charm between two mountains,’ said the dwarf,

3	

3	3	‘because they were proud and ill-behaved, and scorned to ask advice.’

3	

3	3	The prince begged so hard for his brothers, that the dwarf at last set

3	

3	3	them free, though unwillingly, saying, ‘Beware of them, for they have

3	

3	3	bad hearts.’ Their brother, however, was greatly rejoiced to see them,

3	

3	3	and told them all that had happened to him; how he had found the Water

3	

3	3	of Life, and had taken a cup full of it; and how he had set a beautiful

3	

3	3	princess free from a spell that bound her; and how she had engaged to

3	

3	3	wait a whole year, and then to marry him, and to give him the kingdom.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then they all three rode on together, and on their way home came to a

3	

3	3	country that was laid waste by war and a dreadful famine, so that it was

3	

3	3	feared all must die for want. But the prince gave the king of the land

3	

3	3	the bread, and all his kingdom ate of it. And he lent the king the

3	

3	3	wonderful sword, and he slew the enemy’s army with it; and thus the

3	

3	3	kingdom was once more in peace and plenty. In the same manner he

3	

3	3	befriended two other countries through which they passed on their way.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When they came to the sea, they got into a ship and during their voyage

3	

3	3	the two eldest said to themselves, ‘Our brother has got the water which

3	

3	3	we could not find, therefore our father will forsake us and give him the

3	

3	3	kingdom, which is our right’; so they were full of envy and revenge, and

3	

3	3	agreed together how they could ruin him. Then they waited till he was

3	

3	3	fast asleep, and poured the Water of Life out of the cup, and took it

3	

3	3	for themselves, giving him bitter sea-water instead.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When they came to their journey’s end, the youngest son brought his cup

3	

3	3	to the sick king, that he might drink and be healed. Scarcely, however,

3	

3	3	had he tasted the bitter sea-water when he became worse even than he was

3	

3	3	before; and then both the elder sons came in, and blamed the youngest

3	

3	3	for what they had done; and said that he wanted to poison their father,

3	

3	3	but that they had found the Water of Life, and had brought it with them.

3	

3	3	He no sooner began to drink of what they brought him, than he felt his

3	

3	3	sickness leave him, and was as strong and well as in his younger days.

3	

3	3	Then they went to their brother, and laughed at him, and said, ‘Well,

3	

3	3	brother, you found the Water of Life, did you? You have had the trouble

3	

3	3	and we shall have the reward. Pray, with all your cleverness, why did

3	

3	3	not you manage to keep your eyes open? Next year one of us will take

3	

3	3	away your beautiful princess, if you do not take care. You had better

3	

3	3	say nothing about this to our father, for he does not believe a word you

3	

3	3	say; and if you tell tales, you shall lose your life into the bargain:

3	

3	3	but be quiet, and we will let you off.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The old king was still very angry with his youngest son, and thought

3	

3	3	that he really meant to have taken away his life; so he called his court

3	

3	3	together, and asked what should be done, and all agreed that he ought to

3	

3	3	be put to death. The prince knew nothing of what was going on, till one

3	

3	3	day, when the king’s chief huntsmen went a-hunting with him, and they

3	

3	3	were alone in the wood together, the huntsman looked so sorrowful that

3	

3	3	the prince said, ‘My friend, what is the matter with you?’ ‘I cannot and

3	

3	3	dare not tell you,’ said he. But the prince begged very hard, and said,

3	

3	3	‘Only tell me what it is, and do not think I shall be angry, for I will

3	

3	3	forgive you.’ ‘Alas!’ said the huntsman; ‘the king has ordered me to

3	

3	3	shoot you.’ The prince started at this, and said, ‘Let me live, and I

3	

3	3	will change dresses with you; you shall take my royal coat to show to my

3	

3	3	father, and do you give me your shabby one.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said

3	

3	3	the huntsman; ‘I am sure I shall be glad to save you, for I could not

3	

3	3	have shot you.’ Then he took the prince’s coat, and gave him the shabby

3	

3	3	one, and went away through the wood.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Some time after, three grand embassies came to the old king’s court,

3	

3	3	with rich gifts of gold and precious stones for his youngest son; now

3	

3	3	all these were sent from the three kings to whom he had lent his sword

3	

3	3	and loaf of bread, in order to rid them of their enemy and feed their

3	

3	3	people. This touched the old king’s heart, and he thought his son might

3	

3	3	still be guiltless, and said to his court, ‘O that my son were still

3	

3	3	alive! how it grieves me that I had him killed!’ ‘He is still alive,’

3	

3	3	said the huntsman; ‘and I am glad that I had pity on him, but let him

3	

3	3	go in peace, and brought home his royal coat.’ At this the king was

3	

3	3	overwhelmed with joy, and made it known throughout all his kingdom, that

3	

3	3	if his son would come back to his court he would forgive him.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Meanwhile the princess was eagerly waiting till her deliverer should

3	

3	3	come back; and had a road made leading up to her palace all of shining

3	

3	3	gold; and told her courtiers that whoever came on horseback, and rode

3	

3	3	straight up to the gate upon it, was her true lover; and that they must

3	

3	3	let him in: but whoever rode on one side of it, they must be sure was

3	

3	3	not the right one; and that they must send him away at once.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The time soon came, when the eldest brother thought that he would make

3	

3	3	haste to go to the princess, and say that he was the one who had set

3	

3	3	her free, and that he should have her for his wife, and the kingdom with

3	

3	3	her. As he came before the palace and saw the golden road, he stopped to

3	

3	3	look at it, and he thought to himself, ‘It is a pity to ride upon this

3	

3	3	beautiful road’; so he turned aside and rode on the right-hand side of

3	

3	3	it. But when he came to the gate, the guards, who had seen the road

3	

3	3	he took, said to him, he could not be what he said he was, and must go

3	

3	3	about his business.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The second prince set out soon afterwards on the same errand; and when

3	

3	3	he came to the golden road, and his horse had set one foot upon it,

3	

3	3	he stopped to look at it, and thought it very beautiful, and said to

3	

3	3	himself, ‘What a pity it is that anything should tread here!’ Then he

3	

3	3	too turned aside and rode on the left side of it. But when he came to

3	

3	3	the gate the guards said he was not the true prince, and that he too

3	

3	3	must go away about his business; and away he went.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Now when the full year was come round, the third brother left the forest

3	

3	3	in which he had lain hid for fear of his father’s anger, and set out in

3	

3	3	search of his betrothed bride. So he journeyed on, thinking of her all

3	

3	3	the way, and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the road was

3	

3	3	made of, but went with his horse straight over it; and as he came to the

3	

3	3	gate it flew open, and the princess welcomed him with joy, and said

3	

3	3	he was her deliverer, and should now be her husband and lord of the

3	

3	3	kingdom. When the first joy at their meeting was over, the princess told

3	

3	3	him she had heard of his father having forgiven him, and of his wish to

3	

3	3	have him home again: so, before his wedding with the princess, he went

3	

3	3	to visit his father, taking her with him. Then he told him everything;

3	

3	3	how his brothers had cheated and robbed him, and yet that he had borne

3	

3	3	all those wrongs for the love of his father. And the old king was very

3	

3	3	angry, and wanted to punish his wicked sons; but they made their escape,

3	

3	3	and got into a ship and sailed away over the wide sea, and where they

3	

3	3	went to nobody knew and nobody cared.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And now the old king gathered together his court, and asked all his

3	

3	3	kingdom to come and celebrate the wedding of his son and the princess.

3	

3	3	And young and old, noble and squire, gentle and simple, came at once

3	

3	3	on the summons; and among the rest came the friendly dwarf, with the

3	

3	3	sugarloaf hat, and a new scarlet cloak.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	  And the wedding was held, and the merry bells run.

3	

3	3	  And all the good people they danced and they sung,

3	

3	3	  And feasted and frolick’d I can’t tell how long.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	THE TWELVE HUNTSMEN

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There was once a king’s son who had a bride whom he loved very much. And

3	

3	3	when he was sitting beside her and very happy, news came that his father

3	

3	3	lay sick unto death, and desired to see him once again before his end.

3	

3	3	Then he said to his beloved: ‘I must now go and leave you, I give you

3	

3	3	a ring as a remembrance of me. When I am king, I will return and fetch

3	

3	3	you.’ So he rode away, and when he reached his father, the latter was

3	

3	3	dangerously ill, and near his death. He said to him: ‘Dear son, I wished

3	

3	3	to see you once again before my end, promise me to marry as I wish,’ and

3	

3	3	he named a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife. The son was

3	

3	3	in such trouble that he did not think what he was doing, and said: ‘Yes,

3	

3	3	dear father, your will shall be done,’ and thereupon the king shut his

3	

3	3	eyes, and died.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When therefore the son had been proclaimed king, and the time of

3	

3	3	mourning was over, he was forced to keep the promise which he had given

3	

3	3	his father, and caused the king’s daughter to be asked in marriage, and

3	

3	3	she was promised to him. His first betrothed heard of this, and fretted

3	

3	3	so much about his faithfulness that she nearly died. Then her father

3	

3	3	said to her: ‘Dearest child, why are you so sad? You shall have

3	

3	3	whatsoever you will.’ She thought for a moment and said: ‘Dear father,

3	

3	3	I wish for eleven girls exactly like myself in face, figure, and size.’

3	

3	3	The father said: ‘If it be possible, your desire shall be fulfilled,’

3	

3	3	and he caused a search to be made in his whole kingdom, until eleven

3	

3	3	young maidens were found who exactly resembled his daughter in face,

3	

3	3	figure, and size.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When they came to the king’s daughter, she had twelve suits of

3	

3	3	huntsmen’s clothes made, all alike, and the eleven maidens had to put

3	

3	3	on the huntsmen’s clothes, and she herself put on the twelfth suit.

3	

3	3	Thereupon she took her leave of her father, and rode away with them,

3	

3	3	and rode to the court of her former betrothed, whom she loved so dearly.

3	

3	3	Then she asked if he required any huntsmen, and if he would take all of

3	

3	3	them into his service. The king looked at her and did not know her, but

3	

3	3	as they were such handsome fellows, he said: ‘Yes,’ and that he would

3	

3	3	willingly take them, and now they were the king’s twelve huntsmen.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The king, however, had a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew

3	

3	3	all concealed and secret things. It came to pass that one evening he

3	

3	3	said to the king: ‘You think you have twelve huntsmen?’ ‘Yes,’ said the

3	

3	3	king, ‘they are twelve huntsmen.’ The lion continued: ‘You are mistaken,

3	

3	3	they are twelve girls.’ The king said: ‘That cannot be true! How

3	

3	3	will you prove that to me?’ ‘Oh, just let some peas be strewn in the

3	

3	3	ante-chamber,’ answered the lion, ‘and then you will soon see. Men have

3	

3	3	a firm step, and when they walk over peas none of them stir, but girls

3	

3	3	trip and skip, and drag their feet, and the peas roll about.’ The king

3	

3	3	was well pleased with the counsel, and caused the peas to be strewn.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There was, however, a servant of the king’s who favoured the huntsmen,

3	

3	3	and when he heard that they were going to be put to this test he went to

3	

3	3	them and repeated everything, and said: ‘The lion wants to make the king

3	

3	3	believe that you are girls.’ Then the king’s daughter thanked him, and

3	

3	3	said to her maidens: ‘Show some strength, and step firmly on the peas.’

3	

3	3	So next morning when the king had the twelve huntsmen called before

3	

3	3	him, and they came into the ante-chamber where the peas were lying, they

3	

3	3	stepped so firmly on them, and had such a strong, sure walk, that not

3	

3	3	one of the peas either rolled or stirred. Then they went away again,

3	

3	3	and the king said to the lion: ‘You have lied to me, they walk just like

3	

3	3	men.’ The lion said: ‘They have been informed that they were going to

3	

3	3	be put to the test, and have assumed some strength. Just let twelve

3	

3	3	spinning-wheels be brought into the ante-chamber, and they will go to

3	

3	3	them and be pleased with them, and that is what no man would do.’

3	

3	3	The king liked the advice, and had the spinning-wheels placed in the

3	

3	3	ante-chamber.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But the servant, who was well disposed to the huntsmen, went to them,

3	

3	3	and disclosed the project. So when they were alone the king’s daughter

3	

3	3	said to her eleven girls: ‘Show some constraint, and do not look round

3	

3	3	at the spinning-wheels.’ And next morning when the king had his twelve

3	

3	3	huntsmen summoned, they went through the ante-chamber, and never once

3	

3	3	looked at the spinning-wheels. Then the king again said to the lion:

3	

3	3	‘You have deceived me, they are men, for they have not looked at the

3	

3	3	spinning-wheels.’ The lion replied: ‘They have restrained themselves.’

3	

3	3	The king, however, would no longer believe the lion.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The twelve huntsmen always followed the king to the chase, and his

3	

3	3	liking for them continually increased. Now it came to pass that

3	

3	3	once when they were out hunting, news came that the king’s bride was

3	

3	3	approaching. When the true bride heard that, it hurt her so much that

3	

3	3	her heart was almost broken, and she fell fainting to the ground. The

3	

3	3	king thought something had happened to his dear huntsman, ran up to him,

3	

3	3	wanted to help him, and drew his glove off. Then he saw the ring which

3	

3	3	he had given to his first bride, and when he looked in her face he

3	

3	3	recognized her. Then his heart was so touched that he kissed her, and

3	

3	3	when she opened her eyes he said: ‘You are mine, and I am yours, and

3	

3	3	no one in the world can alter that.’ He sent a messenger to the other

3	

3	3	bride, and entreated her to return to her own kingdom, for he had a wife

3	

3	3	already, and someone who had just found an old key did not require a new

3	

3	3	one. Thereupon the wedding was celebrated, and the lion was again taken

3	

3	3	into favour, because, after all, he had told the truth.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	THE KING OF THE GOLDEN MOUNTAIN

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There was once a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very

3	

3	3	young, and barely able to run alone. He had two richly laden ships then

3	

3	3	making a voyage upon the seas, in which he had embarked all his wealth,

3	

3	3	in the hope of making great gains, when the news came that both were

3	

3	3	lost. Thus from being a rich man he became all at once so very poor that

3	

3	3	nothing was left to him but one small plot of land; and there he often

3	

3	3	went in an evening to take his walk, and ease his mind of a little of

3	

3	3	his trouble.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	One day, as he was roaming along in a brown study, thinking with no

3	

3	3	great comfort on what he had been and what he now was, and was like

3	

3	3	to be, all on a sudden there stood before him a little, rough-looking,

3	

3	3	black dwarf. ‘Prithee, friend, why so sorrowful?’ said he to the

3	

3	3	merchant; ‘what is it you take so deeply to heart?’ ‘If you would do me

3	

3	3	any good I would willingly tell you,’ said the merchant. ‘Who knows but

3	

3	3	I may?’ said the little man: ‘tell me what ails you, and perhaps you

3	

3	3	will find I may be of some use.’ Then the merchant told him how all his

3	

3	3	wealth was gone to the bottom of the sea, and how he had nothing left

3	

3	3	but that little plot of land. ‘Oh, trouble not yourself about that,’

3	

3	3	said the dwarf; ‘only undertake to bring me here, twelve years hence,

3	

3	3	whatever meets you first on your going home, and I will give you as much

3	

3	3	as you please.’ The merchant thought this was no great thing to ask;

3	

3	3	that it would most likely be his dog or his cat, or something of that

3	

3	3	sort, but forgot his little boy Heinel; so he agreed to the bargain, and

3	

3	3	signed and sealed the bond to do what was asked of him.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But as he drew near home, his little boy was so glad to see him that he

3	

3	3	crept behind him, and laid fast hold of his legs, and looked up in

3	

3	3	his face and laughed. Then the father started, trembling with fear and

3	

3	3	horror, and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do; but as no

3	

3	3	gold was come, he made himself easy by thinking that it was only a joke

3	

3	3	that the dwarf was playing him, and that, at any rate, when the money

3	

3	3	came, he should see the bearer, and would not take it in.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	About a month afterwards he went upstairs into a lumber-room to look

3	

3	3	for some old iron, that he might sell it and raise a little money; and

3	

3	3	there, instead of his iron, he saw a large pile of gold lying on the

3	

3	3	floor. At the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about

3	

3	3	his son, went into trade again, and became a richer merchant than

3	

3	3	before.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Meantime little Heinel grew up, and as the end of the twelve years drew

3	

3	3	near the merchant began to call to mind his bond, and became very sad

3	

3	3	and thoughtful; so that care and sorrow were written upon his face. The

3	

3	3	boy one day asked what was the matter, but his father would not tell for

3	

3	3	some time; at last, however, he said that he had, without knowing it,

3	

3	3	sold him for gold to a little, ugly-looking, black dwarf, and that the

3	

3	3	twelve years were coming round when he must keep his word. Then Heinel

3	

3	3	said, ‘Father, give yourself very little trouble about that; I shall be

3	

3	3	too much for the little man.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When the time came, the father and son went out together to the place

3	

3	3	agreed upon: and the son drew a circle on the ground, and set himself

3	

3	3	and his father in the middle of it. The little black dwarf soon came,

3	

3	3	and walked round and round about the circle, but could not find any way

3	

3	3	to get into it, and he either could not, or dared not, jump over it. At

3	

3	3	last the boy said to him. ‘Have you anything to say to us, my friend, or

3	

3	3	what do you want?’ Now Heinel had found a friend in a good fairy, that

3	

3	3	was fond of him, and had told him what to do; for this fairy knew what

3	

3	3	good luck was in store for him. ‘Have you brought me what you said you

3	

3	3	would?’ said the dwarf to the merchant. The old man held his tongue, but

3	

3	3	Heinel said again, ‘What do you want here?’ The dwarf said, ‘I come to

3	

3	3	talk with your father, not with you.’ ‘You have cheated and taken in my

3	

3	3	father,’ said the son; ‘pray give him up his bond at once.’ ‘Fair and

3	

3	3	softly,’ said the little old man; ‘right is right; I have paid my money,

3	

3	3	and your father has had it, and spent it; so be so good as to let me

3	

3	3	have what I paid it for.’ ‘You must have my consent to that first,’ said

3	

3	3	Heinel, ‘so please to step in here, and let us talk it over.’ The old

3	

3	3	man grinned, and showed his teeth, as if he should have been very glad

3	

3	3	to get into the circle if he could. Then at last, after a long talk,

3	

3	3	they came to terms. Heinel agreed that his father must give him up, and

3	

3	3	that so far the dwarf should have his way: but, on the other hand, the

3	

3	3	fairy had told Heinel what fortune was in store for him, if he followed

3	

3	3	his own course; and he did not choose to be given up to his hump-backed

3	

3	3	friend, who seemed so anxious for his company.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	So, to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter, it was settled that

3	

3	3	Heinel should be put into an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard

3	

3	3	by; that the father should push him off with his own hand, and that he

3	

3	3	should thus be set adrift, and left to the bad or good luck of wind and

3	

3	3	weather. Then he took leave of his father, and set himself in the boat,

3	

3	3	but before it got far off a wave struck it, and it fell with one side

3	

3	3	low in the water, so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was lost, and

3	

3	3	went home very sorrowful, while the dwarf went his way, thinking that at

3	

3	3	any rate he had had his revenge.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The boat, however, did not sink, for the good fairy took care of her

3	

3	3	friend, and soon raised the boat up again, and it went safely on. The

3	

3	3	young man sat safe within, till at length it ran ashore upon an unknown

3	

3	3	land. As he jumped upon the shore he saw before him a beautiful castle

3	

3	3	but empty and dreary within, for it was enchanted. ‘Here,’ said he to

3	

3	3	himself, ‘must I find the prize the good fairy told me of.’ So he once

3	

3	3	more searched the whole palace through, till at last he found a white

3	

3	3	snake, lying coiled up on a cushion in one of the chambers.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Now the white snake was an enchanted princess; and she was very glad

3	

3	3	to see him, and said, ‘Are you at last come to set me free? Twelve

3	

3	3	long years have I waited here for the fairy to bring you hither as she

3	

3	3	promised, for you alone can save me. This night twelve men will come:

3	

3	3	their faces will be black, and they will be dressed in chain armour.

3	

3	3	They will ask what you do here, but give no answer; and let them do

3	

3	3	what they will--beat, whip, pinch, prick, or torment you--bear all; only

3	

3	3	speak not a word, and at twelve o’clock they must go away. The second

3	

3	3	night twelve others will come: and the third night twenty-four, who

3	

3	3	will even cut off your head; but at the twelfth hour of that night their

3	

3	3	power is gone, and I shall be free, and will come and bring you the

3	

3	3	Water of Life, and will wash you with it, and bring you back to life

3	

3	3	and health.’ And all came to pass as she had said; Heinel bore all, and

3	

3	3	spoke not a word; and the third night the princess came, and fell on his

3	

3	3	neck and kissed him. Joy and gladness burst forth throughout the castle,

3	

3	3	the wedding was celebrated, and he was crowned king of the Golden

3	

3	3	Mountain.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	They lived together very happily, and the queen had a son. And thus

3	

3	3	eight years had passed over their heads, when the king thought of his

3	

3	3	father; and he began to long to see him once again. But the queen was

3	

3	3	against his going, and said, ‘I know well that misfortunes will come

3	

3	3	upon us if you go.’ However, he gave her no rest till she agreed. At his

3	

3	3	going away she gave him a wishing-ring, and said, ‘Take this ring, and

3	

3	3	put it on your finger; whatever you wish it will bring you; only promise

3	

3	3	never to make use of it to bring me hence to your father’s house.’ Then

3	

3	3	he said he would do what she asked, and put the ring on his finger, and

3	

3	3	wished himself near the town where his father lived.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Heinel found himself at the gates in a moment; but the guards would

3	

3	3	not let him go in, because he was so strangely clad. So he went up to a

3	

3	3	neighbouring hill, where a shepherd dwelt, and borrowed his old frock,

3	

3	3	and thus passed unknown into the town. When he came to his father’s

3	

3	3	house, he said he was his son; but the merchant would not believe him,

3	

3	3	and said he had had but one son, his poor Heinel, who he knew was long

3	

3	3	since dead: and as he was only dressed like a poor shepherd, he would

3	

3	3	not even give him anything to eat. The king, however, still vowed that

3	

3	3	he was his son, and said, ‘Is there no mark by which you would know me

3	

3	3	if I am really your son?’ ‘Yes,’ said his mother, ‘our Heinel had a mark

3	

3	3	like a raspberry on his right arm.’ Then he showed them the mark, and

3	

3	3	they knew that what he had said was true.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	He next told them how he was king of the Golden Mountain, and was

3	

3	3	married to a princess, and had a son seven years old. But the merchant

3	

3	3	said, ‘that can never be true; he must be a fine king truly who travels

3	

3	3	about in a shepherd’s frock!’ At this the son was vexed; and forgetting

3	

3	3	his word, turned his ring, and wished for his queen and son. In an

3	

3	3	instant they stood before him; but the queen wept, and said he had

3	

3	3	broken his word, and bad luck would follow. He did all he could to

3	

3	3	soothe her, and she at last seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in

3	

3	3	truth, and was only thinking how she should punish him.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	One day he took her to walk with him out of the town, and showed her

3	

3	3	the spot where the boat was set adrift upon the wide waters. Then he sat

3	

3	3	himself down, and said, ‘I am very much tired; sit by me, I will rest my

3	

3	3	head in your lap, and sleep a while.’ As soon as he had fallen asleep,

3	

3	3	however, she drew the ring from his finger, and crept softly away, and

3	

3	3	wished herself and her son at home in their kingdom. And when he awoke

3	

3	3	he found himself alone, and saw that the ring was gone from his finger.

3	

3	3	‘I can never go back to my father’s house,’ said he; ‘they would say I

3	

3	3	am a sorcerer: I will journey forth into the world, till I come again to

3	

3	3	my kingdom.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	So saying he set out and travelled till he came to a hill, where three

3	

3	3	giants were sharing their father’s goods; and as they saw him pass they

3	

3	3	cried out and said, ‘Little men have sharp wits; he shall part the goods

3	

3	3	between us.’ Now there was a sword that cut off an enemy’s head whenever

3	

3	3	the wearer gave the words, ‘Heads off!’; a cloak that made the owner

3	

3	3	invisible, or gave him any form he pleased; and a pair of boots that

3	

3	3	carried the wearer wherever he wished. Heinel said they must first let

3	

3	3	him try these wonderful things, then he might know how to set a value

3	

3	3	upon them. Then they gave him the cloak, and he wished himself a fly,

3	

3	3	and in a moment he was a fly. ‘The cloak is very well,’ said he: ‘now

3	

3	3	give me the sword.’ ‘No,’ said they; ‘not unless you undertake not to

3	

3	3	say, “Heads off!” for if you do we are all dead men.’ So they gave it

3	

3	3	him, charging him to try it on a tree. He next asked for the boots also;

3	

3	3	and the moment he had all three in his power, he wished himself at

3	

3	3	the Golden Mountain; and there he was at once. So the giants were left

3	

3	3	behind with no goods to share or quarrel about.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	As Heinel came near his castle he heard the sound of merry music; and

3	

3	3	the people around told him that his queen was about to marry another

3	

3	3	husband. Then he threw his cloak around him, and passed through the

3	

3	3	castle hall, and placed himself by the side of the queen, where no one

3	

3	3	saw him. But when anything to eat was put upon her plate, he took it

3	

3	3	away and ate it himself; and when a glass of wine was handed to her, he

3	

3	3	took it and drank it; and thus, though they kept on giving her meat and

3	

3	3	drink, her plate and cup were always empty.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Upon this, fear and remorse came over her, and she went into her chamber

3	

3	3	alone, and sat there weeping; and he followed her there. ‘Alas!’ said

3	

3	3	she to herself, ‘was I not once set free? Why then does this enchantment

3	

3	3	still seem to bind me?’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘False and fickle one!’ said he. ‘One indeed came who set thee free, and

3	

3	3	he is now near thee again; but how have you used him? Ought he to

3	

3	3	have had such treatment from thee?’ Then he went out and sent away the

3	

3	3	company, and said the wedding was at an end, for that he was come back

3	

3	3	to the kingdom. But the princes, peers, and great men mocked at him.

3	

3	3	However, he would enter into no parley with them, but only asked them

3	

3	3	if they would go in peace or not. Then they turned upon him and tried

3	

3	3	to seize him; but he drew his sword. ‘Heads Off!’ cried he; and with the

3	

3	3	word the traitors’ heads fell before him, and Heinel was once more king

3	

3	3	of the Golden Mountain.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	DOCTOR KNOWALL

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with

3	

3	3	two oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two

3	

3	3	talers. When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that

3	

3	3	the doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how well he

3	

3	3	ate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and would willingly

3	

3	3	have been a doctor too. So he remained standing a while, and at length

3	

3	3	inquired if he too could not be a doctor. ‘Oh, yes,’ said the doctor,

3	

3	3	‘that is soon managed.’ ‘What must I do?’ asked the peasant. ‘In the

3	

3	3	first place buy yourself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on

3	

3	3	the frontispiece; in the second, turn your cart and your two oxen into

3	

3	3	money, and get yourself some clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to

3	

3	3	medicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for yourself with the words: “I

3	

3	3	am Doctor Knowall,” and have that nailed up above your house-door.’ The

3	

3	3	peasant did everything that he had been told to do. When he had doctored

3	

3	3	people awhile, but not long, a rich and great lord had some money

3	

3	3	stolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such

3	

3	3	a village, and must know what had become of the money. So the lord had

3	

3	3	the horses harnessed to his carriage, drove out to the village, and

3	

3	3	asked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall. Yes, he was, he said. Then he was

3	

3	3	to go with him and bring back the stolen money. ‘Oh, yes, but Grete, my

3	

3	3	wife, must go too.’ The lord was willing, and let both of them have a

3	

3	3	seat in the carriage, and they all drove away together. When they came

3	

3	3	to the nobleman’s castle, the table was spread, and Crabb was told to

3	

3	3	sit down and eat. ‘Yes, but my wife, Grete, too,’ said he, and he seated

3	

3	3	himself with her at the table. And when the first servant came with a

3	

3	3	dish of delicate fare, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: ‘Grete,

3	

3	3	that was the first,’ meaning that was the servant who brought the first

3	

3	3	dish. The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say: ‘That is

3	

3	3	the first thief,’ and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said

3	

3	3	to his comrade outside: ‘The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he

3	

3	3	said I was the first.’ The second did not want to go in at all, but was

3	

3	3	forced. So when he went in with his dish, the peasant nudged his wife,

3	

3	3	and said: ‘Grete, that is the second.’ This servant was equally alarmed,

3	

3	3	and he got out as fast as he could. The third fared no better, for the

3	

3	3	peasant again said: ‘Grete, that is the third.’ The fourth had to carry

3	

3	3	in a dish that was covered, and the lord told the doctor that he was to

3	

3	3	show his skill, and guess what was beneath the cover. Actually, there

3	

3	3	were crabs. The doctor looked at the dish, had no idea what to say, and

3	

3	3	cried: ‘Ah, poor Crabb.’ When the lord heard that, he cried: ‘There! he

3	

3	3	knows it; he must also know who has the money!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	On this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the

3	

3	3	doctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When therefore

3	

3	3	he went out, all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen

3	

3	3	the money, and said that they would willingly restore it and give him a

3	

3	3	heavy sum into the bargain, if he would not denounce them, for if he

3	

3	3	did they would be hanged. They led him to the spot where the money was

3	

3	3	concealed. With this the doctor was satisfied, and returned to the hall,

3	

3	3	sat down to the table, and said: ‘My lord, now will I search in my book

3	

3	3	where the gold is hidden.’ The fifth servant, however, crept into the

3	

3	3	stove to hear if the doctor knew still more. But the doctor sat still

3	

3	3	and opened his A B C book, turned the pages backwards and forwards, and

3	

3	3	looked for the cock. As he could not find it immediately he said: ‘I

3	

3	3	know you are there, so you had better come out!’ Then the fellow in the

3	

3	3	stove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out,

3	

3	3	crying: ‘That man knows everything!’ Then Doctor Knowall showed the lord

3	

3	3	where the money was, but did not say who had stolen it, and received

3	

3	3	from both sides much money in reward, and became a renowned man.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	THE SEVEN RAVENS

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There was once a man who had seven sons, and last of all one daughter.

3	

3	3	Although the little girl was very pretty, she was so weak and small that

3	

3	3	they thought she could not live; but they said she should at once be

3	

3	3	christened.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	So the father sent one of his sons in haste to the spring to get some

3	

3	3	water, but the other six ran with him. Each wanted to be first at

3	

3	3	drawing the water, and so they were in such a hurry that all let their

3	

3	3	pitchers fall into the well, and they stood very foolishly looking at

3	

3	3	one another, and did not know what to do, for none dared go home. In the

3	

3	3	meantime the father was uneasy, and could not tell what made the

3	

3	3	young men stay so long. ‘Surely,’ said he, ‘the whole seven must have

3	

3	3	forgotten themselves over some game of play’; and when he had waited

3	

3	3	still longer and they yet did not come, he flew into a rage and wished

3	

3	3	them all turned into ravens. Scarcely had he spoken these words when he

3	

3	3	heard a croaking over his head, and looked up and saw seven ravens as

3	

3	3	black as coal flying round and round. Sorry as he was to see his wish

3	

3	3	so fulfilled, he did not know how what was done could be undone, and

3	

3	3	comforted himself as well as he could for the loss of his seven sons

3	

3	3	with his dear little daughter, who soon became stronger and every day

3	

3	3	more beautiful.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	For a long time she did not know that she had ever had any brothers; for

3	

3	3	her father and mother took care not to speak of them before her: but one

3	

3	3	day by chance she heard the people about her speak of them. ‘Yes,’ said

3	

3	3	they, ‘she is beautiful indeed, but still ‘tis a pity that her brothers

3	

3	3	should have been lost for her sake.’ Then she was much grieved, and went

3	

3	3	to her father and mother, and asked if she had any brothers, and what

3	

3	3	had become of them. So they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but

3	

3	3	said it was the will of Heaven, and that her birth was only the innocent

3	

3	3	cause of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day, and

3	

3	3	thought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back;

3	

3	3	and she had neither rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole

3	

3	3	away, and set out into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever

3	

3	3	they might be, and free them, whatever it might cost her.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	She took nothing with her but a little ring which her father and mother

3	

3	3	had given her, a loaf of bread in case she should be hungry, a little

3	

3	3	pitcher of water in case she should be thirsty, and a little stool

3	

3	3	to rest upon when she should be weary. Thus she went on and on, and

3	

3	3	journeyed till she came to the world’s end; then she came to the sun,

3	

3	3	but the sun looked much too hot and fiery; so she ran away quickly to

3	

3	3	the moon, but the moon was cold and chilly, and said, ‘I smell flesh

3	

3	3	and blood this way!’ so she took herself away in a hurry and came to the

3	

3	3	stars, and the stars were friendly and kind to her, and each star sat

3	

3	3	upon his own little stool; but the morning star rose up and gave her a

3	

3	3	little piece of wood, and said, ‘If you have not this little piece of

3	

3	3	wood, you cannot unlock the castle that stands on the glass-mountain,

3	

3	3	and there your brothers live.’ The little girl took the piece of wood,

3	

3	3	rolled it up in a little cloth, and went on again until she came to the

3	

3	3	glass-mountain, and found the door shut. Then she felt for the little

3	

3	3	piece of wood; but when she unwrapped the cloth it was not there, and

3	

3	3	she saw she had lost the gift of the good stars. What was to be done?

3	

3	3	She wanted to save her brothers, and had no key of the castle of the

3	

3	3	glass-mountain; so this faithful little sister took a knife out of her

3	

3	3	pocket and cut off her little finger, that was just the size of the

3	

3	3	piece of wood she had lost, and put it in the door and opened it.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	As she went in, a little dwarf came up to her, and said, ‘What are you

3	

3	3	seeking for?’ ‘I seek for my brothers, the seven ravens,’ answered she.

3	

3	3	Then the dwarf said, ‘My masters are not at home; but if you will wait

3	

3	3	till they come, pray step in.’ Now the little dwarf was getting their

3	

3	3	dinner ready, and he brought their food upon seven little plates, and

3	

3	3	their drink in seven little glasses, and set them upon the table, and

3	

3	3	out of each little plate their sister ate a small piece, and out of each

3	

3	3	little glass she drank a small drop; but she let the ring that she had

3	

3	3	brought with her fall into the last glass.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	On a sudden she heard a fluttering and croaking in the air, and the

3	

3	3	dwarf said, ‘Here come my masters.’ When they came in, they wanted to

3	

3	3	eat and drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses. Then said

3	

3	3	one after the other,

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Who has eaten from my little plate? And who has been drinking out of my

3	

3	3	little glass?’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Caw! Caw! well I ween

3	

3	3	  Mortal lips have this way been.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When the seventh came to the bottom of his glass, and found there the

3	

3	3	ring, he looked at it, and knew that it was his father’s and mother’s,

3	

3	3	and said, ‘O that our little sister would but come! then we should be

3	

3	3	free.’ When the little girl heard this (for she stood behind the door

3	

3	3	all the time and listened), she ran forward, and in an instant all

3	

3	3	the ravens took their right form again; and all hugged and kissed each

3	

3	3	other, and went merrily home.

3	

3	3	THE WEDDING OF MRS FOX

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	FIRST STORY

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There was once upon a time an old fox with nine tails, who believed that

3	

3	3	his wife was not faithful to him, and wished to put her to the test. He

3	

3	3	stretched himself out under the bench, did not move a limb, and behaved

3	

3	3	as if he were stone dead. Mrs Fox went up to her room, shut herself in,

3	

3	3	and her maid, Miss Cat, sat by the fire, and did the cooking. When it

3	

3	3	became known that the old fox was dead, suitors presented themselves.

3	

3	3	The maid heard someone standing at the house-door, knocking. She went

3	

3	3	and opened it, and it was a young fox, who said:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘What may you be about, Miss Cat?

3	

3	3	  Do you sleep or do you wake?’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	She answered:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘I am not sleeping, I am waking,

3	

3	3	  Would you know what I am making?

3	

3	3	  I am boiling warm beer with butter,

3	

3	3	  Will you be my guest for supper?’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘No, thank you, miss,’ said the fox, ‘what is Mrs Fox doing?’ The maid

3	

3	3	replied:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘She is sitting in her room,

3	

3	3	  Moaning in her gloom,

3	

3	3	  Weeping her little eyes quite red,

3	

3	3	  Because old Mr Fox is dead.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Do just tell her, miss, that a young fox is here, who would like to woo

3	

3	3	her.’ ‘Certainly, young sir.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	  The cat goes up the stairs trip, trap,

3	

3	3	  The door she knocks at tap, tap, tap,

3	

3	3	 ‘Mistress Fox, are you inside?’

3	

3	3	 ‘Oh, yes, my little cat,’ she cried.

3	

3	3	 ‘A wooer he stands at the door out there.’

3	

3	3	 ‘What does he look like, my dear?’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Has he nine as beautiful tails as the late Mr Fox?’ ‘Oh, no,’ answered

3	

3	3	the cat, ‘he has only one.’ ‘Then I will not have him.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Miss Cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away. Soon afterwards there

3	

3	3	was another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs

3	

3	3	Fox. He had two tails, but he did not fare better than the first. After

3	

3	3	this still more came, each with one tail more than the other, but they

3	

3	3	were all turned away, until at last one came who had nine tails, like

3	

3	3	old Mr Fox. When the widow heard that, she said joyfully to the cat:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Now open the gates and doors all wide,

3	

3	3	  And carry old Mr Fox outside.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But just as the wedding was going to be solemnized, old Mr Fox stirred

3	

3	3	under the bench, and cudgelled all the rabble, and drove them and Mrs

3	

3	3	Fox out of the house.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	SECOND STORY

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When old Mr Fox was dead, the wolf came as a suitor, and knocked at the

3	

3	3	door, and the cat who was servant to Mrs Fox, opened it for him. The

3	

3	3	wolf greeted her, and said:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Good day, Mrs Cat of Kehrewit,

3	

3	3	  How comes it that alone you sit?

3	

3	3	  What are you making good?’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The cat replied:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘In milk I’m breaking bread so sweet,

3	

3	3	  Will you be my guest, and eat?’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘No, thank you, Mrs Cat,’ answered the wolf. ‘Is Mrs Fox not at home?’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The cat said:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘She sits upstairs in her room,

3	

3	3	  Bewailing her sorrowful doom,

3	

3	3	  Bewailing her trouble so sore,

3	

3	3	  For old Mr Fox is no more.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The wolf answered:

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘If she’s in want of a husband now,

3	

3	3	  Then will it please her to step below?’

3	

3	3	  The cat runs quickly up the stair,

3	

3	3	  And lets her tail fly here and there,

3	

3	3	  Until she comes to the parlour door.

3	

3	3	  With her five gold rings at the door she knocks:

3	

3	3	 ‘Are you within, good Mistress Fox?

3	

3	3	  If you’re in want of a husband now,

3	

3	3	  Then will it please you to step below?

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Mrs Fox asked: ‘Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has he a pointed

3	

3	3	mouth?’ ‘No,’ answered the cat. ‘Then he won’t do for me.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When the wolf was gone, came a dog, a stag, a hare, a bear, a lion, and

3	

3	3	all the beasts of the forest, one after the other. But one of the good

3	

3	3	qualities which old Mr Fox had possessed, was always lacking, and the

3	

3	3	cat had continually to send the suitors away. At length came a young

3	

3	3	fox. Then Mrs Fox said: ‘Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has a

3	

3	3	little pointed mouth?’ ‘Yes,’ said the cat, ‘he has.’ ‘Then let him come

3	

3	3	upstairs,’ said Mrs Fox, and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding

3	

3	3	feast.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	 ‘Sweep me the room as clean as you can,

3	

3	3	  Up with the window, fling out my old man!

3	

3	3	  For many a fine fat mouse he brought,

3	

3	3	  Yet of his wife he never thought,

3	

3	3	  But ate up every one he caught.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the wedding was solemnized with young Mr Fox, and there was much

3	

3	3	rejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off, they are dancing

3	

3	3	still.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	THE SALAD

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	As a merry young huntsman was once going briskly along through a wood,

3	

3	3	there came up a little old woman, and said to him, ‘Good day, good day;

3	

3	3	you seem merry enough, but I am hungry and thirsty; do pray give me

3	

3	3	something to eat.’ The huntsman took pity on her, and put his hand in

3	

3	3	his pocket and gave her what he had. Then he wanted to go his way; but

3	

3	3	she took hold of him, and said, ‘Listen, my friend, to what I am going

3	

3	3	to tell you; I will reward you for your kindness; go your way, and after

3	

3	3	a little time you will come to a tree where you will see nine birds

3	

3	3	sitting on a cloak. Shoot into the midst of them, and one will fall down

3	

3	3	dead: the cloak will fall too; take it, it is a wishing-cloak, and when

3	

3	3	you wear it you will find yourself at any place where you may wish to

3	

3	3	be. Cut open the dead bird, take out its heart and keep it, and you will

3	

3	3	find a piece of gold under your pillow every morning when you rise. It

3	

3	3	is the bird’s heart that will bring you this good luck.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, ‘If all this does

3	

3	3	happen, it will be a fine thing for me.’ When he had gone a hundred

3	

3	3	steps or so, he heard a screaming and chirping in the branches over him,

3	

3	3	and looked up and saw a flock of birds pulling a cloak with their bills

3	

3	3	and feet; screaming, fighting, and tugging at each other as if

3	

3	3	each wished to have it himself. ‘Well,’ said the huntsman, ‘this is

3	

3	3	wonderful; this happens just as the old woman said’; then he shot into

3	

3	3	the midst of them so that their feathers flew all about. Off went the

3	

3	3	flock chattering away; but one fell down dead, and the cloak with it.

3	

3	3	Then the huntsman did as the old woman told him, cut open the bird, took

3	

3	3	out the heart, and carried the cloak home with him.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The next morning when he awoke he lifted up his pillow, and there lay

3	

3	3	the piece of gold glittering underneath; the same happened next day, and

3	

3	3	indeed every day when he arose. He heaped up a great deal of gold, and

3	

3	3	at last thought to himself, ‘Of what use is this gold to me whilst I am

3	

3	3	at home? I will go out into the world and look about me.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then he took leave of his friends, and hung his bag and bow about his

3	

3	3	neck, and went his way. It so happened that his road one day led through

3	

3	3	a thick wood, at the end of which was a large castle in a green meadow,

3	

3	3	and at one of the windows stood an old woman with a very beautiful young

3	

3	3	lady by her side looking about them. Now the old woman was a witch, and

3	

3	3	said to the young lady, ‘There is a young man coming out of the wood who

3	

3	3	carries a wonderful prize; we must get it away from him, my dear child,

3	

3	3	for it is more fit for us than for him. He has a bird’s heart that

3	

3	3	brings a piece of gold under his pillow every morning.’ Meantime the

3	

3	3	huntsman came nearer and looked at the lady, and said to himself, ‘I

3	

3	3	have been travelling so long that I should like to go into this castle

3	

3	3	and rest myself, for I have money enough to pay for anything I want’;

3	

3	3	but the real reason was, that he wanted to see more of the beautiful

3	

3	3	lady. Then he went into the house, and was welcomed kindly; and it was

3	

3	3	not long before he was so much in love that he thought of nothing else

3	

3	3	but looking at the lady’s eyes, and doing everything that she wished.

3	

3	3	Then the old woman said, ‘Now is the time for getting the bird’s heart.’

3	

3	3	So the lady stole it away, and he never found any more gold under his

3	

3	3	pillow, for it lay now under the young lady’s, and the old woman took it

3	

3	3	away every morning; but he was so much in love that he never missed his

3	

3	3	prize.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Well,’ said the old witch, ‘we have got the bird’s heart, but not the

3	

3	3	wishing-cloak yet, and that we must also get.’ ‘Let us leave him that,’

3	

3	3	said the young lady; ‘he has already lost his wealth.’ Then the witch

3	

3	3	was very angry, and said, ‘Such a cloak is a very rare and wonderful

3	

3	3	thing, and I must and will have it.’ So she did as the old woman told

3	

3	3	her, and set herself at the window, and looked about the country and

3	

3	3	seemed very sorrowful; then the huntsman said, ‘What makes you so sad?’

3	

3	3	‘Alas! dear sir,’ said she, ‘yonder lies the granite rock where all the

3	

3	3	costly diamonds grow, and I want so much to go there, that whenever I

3	

3	3	think of it I cannot help being sorrowful, for who can reach it? only

3	

3	3	the birds and the flies--man cannot.’ ‘If that’s all your grief,’ said

3	

3	3	the huntsman, ‘I’ll take you there with all my heart’; so he drew her under

3	

3	3	his cloak, and the moment he wished to be on the granite mountain they

3	

3	3	were both there. The diamonds glittered so on all sides that they were

3	

3	3	delighted with the sight and picked up the finest. But the old witch

3	

3	3	made a deep sleep come upon him, and he said to the young lady, ‘Let us

3	

3	3	sit down and rest ourselves a little, I am so tired that I cannot stand

3	

3	3	any longer.’ So they sat down, and he laid his head in her lap and

3	

3	3	fell asleep; and whilst he was sleeping on she took the cloak from

3	

3	3	his shoulders, hung it on her own, picked up the diamonds, and wished

3	

3	3	herself home again.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him, and left him

3	

3	3	alone on the wild rock, he said, ‘Alas! what roguery there is in the

3	

3	3	world!’ and there he sat in great grief and fear, not knowing what to

3	

3	3	do. Now this rock belonged to fierce giants who lived upon it; and as

3	

3	3	he saw three of them striding about, he thought to himself, ‘I can only

3	

3	3	save myself by feigning to be asleep’; so he laid himself down as if he

3	

3	3	were in a sound sleep. When the giants came up to him, the first pushed

3	

3	3	him with his foot, and said, ‘What worm is this that lies here curled

3	

3	3	up?’ ‘Tread upon him and kill him,’ said the second. ‘It’s not worth the

3	

3	3	trouble,’ said the third; ‘let him live, he’ll go climbing higher up the

3	

3	3	mountain, and some cloud will come rolling and carry him away.’ And they

3	

3	3	passed on. But the huntsman had heard all they said; and as soon as they

3	

3	3	were gone, he climbed to the top of the mountain, and when he had sat

3	

3	3	there a short time a cloud came rolling around him, and caught him in a

3	

3	3	whirlwind and bore him along for some time, till it settled in a garden,

3	

3	3	and he fell quite gently to the ground amongst the greens and cabbages.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then he looked around him, and said, ‘I wish I had something to eat, if

3	

3	3	not I shall be worse off than before; for here I see neither apples

3	

3	3	nor pears, nor any kind of fruits, nothing but vegetables.’ At last he

3	

3	3	thought to himself, ‘I can eat salad, it will refresh and strengthen

3	

3	3	me.’ So he picked out a fine head and ate of it; but scarcely had he

3	

3	3	swallowed two bites when he felt himself quite changed, and saw with

3	

3	3	horror that he was turned into an ass. However, he still felt very

3	

3	3	hungry, and the salad tasted very nice; so he ate on till he came

3	

3	3	to another kind of salad, and scarcely had he tasted it when he felt

3	

3	3	another change come over him, and soon saw that he was lucky enough to

3	

3	3	have found his old shape again.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then he laid himself down and slept off a little of his weariness; and

3	

3	3	when he awoke the next morning he broke off a head both of the good and

3	

3	3	the bad salad, and thought to himself, ‘This will help me to my fortune

3	

3	3	again, and enable me to pay off some folks for their treachery.’ So he

3	

3	3	went away to try and find the castle of his friends; and after wandering

3	

3	3	about a few days he luckily found it. Then he stained his face all over

3	

3	3	brown, so that even his mother would not have known him, and went into

3	

3	3	the castle and asked for a lodging; ‘I am so tired,’ said he, ‘that I

3	

3	3	can go no farther.’ ‘Countryman,’ said the witch, ‘who are you? and what

3	

3	3	is your business?’ ‘I am,’ said he, ‘a messenger sent by the king to

3	

3	3	find the finest salad that grows under the sun. I have been lucky

3	

3	3	enough to find it, and have brought it with me; but the heat of the sun

3	

3	3	scorches so that it begins to wither, and I don’t know that I can carry

3	

3	3	it farther.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When the witch and the young lady heard of his beautiful salad, they

3	

3	3	longed to taste it, and said, ‘Dear countryman, let us just taste it.’

3	

3	3	‘To be sure,’ answered he; ‘I have two heads of it with me, and will

3	

3	3	give you one’; so he opened his bag and gave them the bad. Then the

3	

3	3	witch herself took it into the kitchen to be dressed; and when it was

3	

3	3	ready she could not wait till it was carried up, but took a few leaves

3	

3	3	immediately and put them in her mouth, and scarcely were they swallowed

3	

3	3	when she lost her own form and ran braying down into the court in the

3	

3	3	form of an ass. Now the servant-maid came into the kitchen, and seeing

3	

3	3	the salad ready, was going to carry it up; but on the way she too felt a

3	

3	3	wish to taste it as the old woman had done, and ate some leaves; so she

3	

3	3	also was turned into an ass and ran after the other, letting the dish

3	

3	3	with the salad fall on the ground. The messenger sat all this time with

3	

3	3	the beautiful young lady, and as nobody came with the salad and she

3	

3	3	longed to taste it, she said, ‘I don’t know where the salad can be.’

3	

3	3	Then he thought something must have happened, and said, ‘I will go

3	

3	3	into the kitchen and see.’ And as he went he saw two asses in the court

3	

3	3	running about, and the salad lying on the ground. ‘All right!’ said

3	

3	3	he; ‘those two have had their share.’ Then he took up the rest of

3	

3	3	the leaves, laid them on the dish and brought them to the young lady,

3	

3	3	saying, ‘I bring you the dish myself that you may not wait any longer.’

3	

3	3	So she ate of it, and like the others ran off into the court braying

3	

3	3	away.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the huntsman washed his face and went into the court that they

3	

3	3	might know him. ‘Now you shall be paid for your roguery,’ said he; and

3	

3	3	tied them all three to a rope and took them along with him till he

3	

3	3	came to a mill and knocked at the window. ‘What’s the matter?’ said the

3	

3	3	miller. ‘I have three tiresome beasts here,’ said the other; ‘if you

3	

3	3	will take them, give them food and room, and treat them as I tell you,

3	

3	3	I will pay you whatever you ask.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said the miller;

3	

3	3	‘but how shall I treat them?’ Then the huntsman said, ‘Give the old

3	

3	3	one stripes three times a day and hay once; give the next (who was

3	

3	3	the servant-maid) stripes once a day and hay three times; and give

3	

3	3	the youngest (who was the beautiful lady) hay three times a day and

3	

3	3	no stripes’: for he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten.

3	

3	3	After this he went back to the castle, where he found everything he

3	

3	3	wanted.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Some days after, the miller came to him and told him that the old ass

3	

3	3	was dead; ‘The other two,’ said he, ‘are alive and eat, but are so

3	

3	3	sorrowful that they cannot last long.’ Then the huntsman pitied them,

3	

3	3	and told the miller to drive them back to him, and when they came, he

3	

3	3	gave them some of the good salad to eat. And the beautiful young lady

3	

3	3	fell upon her knees before him, and said, ‘O dearest huntsman! forgive

3	

3	3	me all the ill I have done you; my mother forced me to it, it was

3	

3	3	against my will, for I always loved you very much. Your wishing-cloak

3	

3	3	hangs up in the closet, and as for the bird’s heart, I will give it you

3	

3	3	too.’ But he said, ‘Keep it, it will be just the same thing, for I mean

3	

3	3	to make you my wife.’ So they were married, and lived together very

3	

3	3	happily till they died.

3	3	THE STORY OF THE YOUTH WHO WENT FORTH TO LEARN WHAT FEAR WAS

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	A certain father had two sons, the elder of who was smart and sensible,

3	

3	3	and could do everything, but the younger was stupid and could neither

3	

3	3	learn nor understand anything, and when people saw him they said:

3	

3	3	‘There’s a fellow who will give his father some trouble!’ When anything

3	

3	3	had to be done, it was always the elder who was forced to do it; but

3	

3	3	if his father bade him fetch anything when it was late, or in the

3	

3	3	night-time, and the way led through the churchyard, or any other dismal

3	

3	3	place, he answered: ‘Oh, no father, I’ll not go there, it makes me

3	

3	3	shudder!’ for he was afraid. Or when stories were told by the fire at

3	

3	3	night which made the flesh creep, the listeners sometimes said: ‘Oh,

3	

3	3	it makes us shudder!’ The younger sat in a corner and listened with

3	

3	3	the rest of them, and could not imagine what they could mean. ‘They are

3	

3	3	always saying: “It makes me shudder, it makes me shudder!” It does not

3	

3	3	make me shudder,’ thought he. ‘That, too, must be an art of which I

3	

3	3	understand nothing!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Now it came to pass that his father said to him one day: ‘Hearken to me,

3	

3	3	you fellow in the corner there, you are growing tall and strong, and you

3	

3	3	too must learn something by which you can earn your bread. Look how your

3	

3	3	brother works, but you do not even earn your salt.’ ‘Well, father,’ he

3	

3	3	replied, ‘I am quite willing to learn something--indeed, if it could but

3	

3	3	be managed, I should like to learn how to shudder. I don’t understand

3	

3	3	that at all yet.’ The elder brother smiled when he heard that, and

3	

3	3	thought to himself: ‘Goodness, what a blockhead that brother of mine is!

3	

3	3	He will never be good for anything as long as he lives! He who wants to

3	

3	3	be a sickle must bend himself betimes.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The father sighed, and answered him: ‘You shall soon learn what it is to

3	

3	3	shudder, but you will not earn your bread by that.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Soon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and the father

3	

3	3	bewailed his trouble, and told him how his younger son was so backward

3	

3	3	in every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing. ‘Just think,’

3	

3	3	said he, ‘when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread, he

3	

3	3	actually wanted to learn to shudder.’ ‘If that be all,’ replied the

3	

3	3	sexton, ‘he can learn that with me. Send him to me, and I will soon

3	

3	3	polish him.’ The father was glad to do it, for he thought: ‘It will

3	

3	3	train the boy a little.’ The sexton therefore took him into his house,

3	

3	3	and he had to ring the church bell. After a day or two, the sexton awoke

3	

3	3	him at midnight, and bade him arise and go up into the church tower and

3	

3	3	ring the bell. ‘You shall soon learn what shuddering is,’ thought he,

3	

3	3	and secretly went there before him; and when the boy was at the top of

3	

3	3	the tower and turned round, and was just going to take hold of the bell

3	

3	3	rope, he saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite the sounding

3	

3	3	hole. ‘Who is there?’ cried he, but the figure made no reply, and did

3	

3	3	not move or stir. ‘Give an answer,’ cried the boy, ‘or take yourself

3	

3	3	off, you have no business here at night.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The sexton, however, remained standing motionless that the boy might

3	

3	3	think he was a ghost. The boy cried a second time: ‘What do you want

3	

3	3	here?--speak if you are an honest fellow, or I will throw you down the

3	

3	3	steps!’ The sexton thought: ‘He can’t mean to be as bad as his words,’

3	

3	3	uttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone. Then the boy

3	

3	3	called to him for the third time, and as that was also to no purpose,

3	

3	3	he ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs, so that it fell

3	

3	3	down the ten steps and remained lying there in a corner. Thereupon he

3	

3	3	rang the bell, went home, and without saying a word went to bed, and

3	

3	3	fell asleep. The sexton’s wife waited a long time for her husband, but

3	

3	3	he did not come back. At length she became uneasy, and wakened the boy,

3	

3	3	and asked: ‘Do you know where my husband is? He climbed up the tower

3	

3	3	before you did.’ ‘No, I don’t know,’ replied the boy, ‘but someone was

3	

3	3	standing by the sounding hole on the other side of the steps, and as he

3	

3	3	would neither gave an answer nor go away, I took him for a scoundrel,

3	

3	3	and threw him downstairs. Just go there and you will see if it was he.

3	

3	3	I should be sorry if it were.’ The woman ran away and found her husband,

3	

3	3	who was lying moaning in the corner, and had broken his leg.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	She carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the

3	

3	3	boy’s father, ‘Your boy,’ cried she, ‘has been the cause of a great

3	

3	3	misfortune! He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke his

3	

3	3	leg. Take the good-for-nothing fellow out of our house.’ The father was

3	

3	3	terrified, and ran thither and scolded the boy. ‘What wicked tricks

3	

3	3	are these?’ said he. ‘The devil must have put them into your head.’

3	

3	3	‘Father,’ he replied, ‘do listen to me. I am quite innocent. He was

3	

3	3	standing there by night like one intent on doing evil. I did not know

3	

3	3	who it was, and I entreated him three times either to speak or to go

3	

3	3	away.’ ‘Ah,’ said the father, ‘I have nothing but unhappiness with you.

3	

3	3	Go out of my sight. I will see you no more.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Yes, father, right willingly, wait only until it is day. Then will I

3	

3	3	go forth and learn how to shudder, and then I shall, at any rate,

3	

3	3	understand one art which will support me.’ ‘Learn what you will,’ spoke

3	

3	3	the father, ‘it is all the same to me. Here are fifty talers for you.

3	

3	3	Take these and go into the wide world, and tell no one from whence you

3	

3	3	come, and who is your father, for I have reason to be ashamed of you.’

3	

3	3	‘Yes, father, it shall be as you will. If you desire nothing more than

3	

3	3	that, I can easily keep it in mind.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When the day dawned, therefore, the boy put his fifty talers into his

3	

3	3	pocket, and went forth on the great highway, and continually said to

3	

3	3	himself: ‘If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!’ Then a man

3	

3	3	approached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding with

3	

3	3	himself, and when they had walked a little farther to where they could

3	

3	3	see the gallows, the man said to him: ‘Look, there is the tree where

3	

3	3	seven men have married the ropemaker’s daughter, and are now learning

3	

3	3	how to fly. Sit down beneath it, and wait till night comes, and you will

3	

3	3	soon learn how to shudder.’ ‘If that is all that is wanted,’ answered

3	

3	3	the youth, ‘it is easily done; but if I learn how to shudder as fast as

3	

3	3	that, you shall have my fifty talers. Just come back to me early in the

3	

3	3	morning.’ Then the youth went to the gallows, sat down beneath it, and

3	

3	3	waited till evening came. And as he was cold, he lighted himself a fire,

3	

3	3	but at midnight the wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire, he

3	

3	3	could not get warm. And as the wind knocked the hanged men against each

3	

3	3	other, and they moved backwards and forwards, he thought to himself:

3	

3	3	‘If you shiver below by the fire, how those up above must freeze and

3	

3	3	suffer!’ And as he felt pity for them, he raised the ladder, and climbed

3	

3	3	up, unbound one of them after the other, and brought down all seven.

3	

3	3	Then he stoked the fire, blew it, and set them all round it to warm

3	

3	3	themselves. But they sat there and did not stir, and the fire caught

3	

3	3	their clothes. So he said: ‘Take care, or I will hang you up again.’ The

3	

3	3	dead men, however, did not hear, but were quite silent, and let their

3	

3	3	rags go on burning. At this he grew angry, and said: ‘If you will not

3	

3	3	take care, I cannot help you, I will not be burnt with you,’ and he hung

3	

3	3	them up again each in his turn. Then he sat down by his fire and fell

3	

3	3	asleep, and the next morning the man came to him and wanted to have

3	

3	3	the fifty talers, and said: ‘Well do you know how to shudder?’ ‘No,’

3	

3	3	answered he, ‘how should I know? Those fellows up there did not open

3	

3	3	their mouths, and were so stupid that they let the few old rags which

3	

3	3	they had on their bodies get burnt.’ Then the man saw that he would not

3	

3	3	get the fifty talers that day, and went away saying: ‘Such a youth has

3	

3	3	never come my way before.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The youth likewise went his way, and once more began to mutter to

3	

3	3	himself: ‘Ah, if I could but shudder! Ah, if I could but shudder!’ A

3	

3	3	waggoner who was striding behind him heard this and asked: ‘Who are

3	

3	3	you?’ ‘I don’t know,’ answered the youth. Then the waggoner asked: ‘From

3	

3	3	whence do you come?’ ‘I know not.’ ‘Who is your father?’ ‘That I may

3	

3	3	not tell you.’ ‘What is it that you are always muttering between your

3	

3	3	teeth?’ ‘Ah,’ replied the youth, ‘I do so wish I could shudder, but

3	

3	3	no one can teach me how.’ ‘Enough of your foolish chatter,’ said the

3	

3	3	waggoner. ‘Come, go with me, I will see about a place for you.’ The

3	

3	3	youth went with the waggoner, and in the evening they arrived at an inn

3	

3	3	where they wished to pass the night. Then at the entrance of the parlour

3	

3	3	the youth again said quite loudly: ‘If I could but shudder! If I could

3	

3	3	but shudder!’ The host who heard this, laughed and said: ‘If that is

3	

3	3	your desire, there ought to be a good opportunity for you here.’ ‘Ah,

3	

3	3	be silent,’ said the hostess, ‘so many prying persons have already lost

3	

3	3	their lives, it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as

3	

3	3	these should never see the daylight again.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But the youth said: ‘However difficult it may be, I will learn it. For

3	

3	3	this purpose indeed have I journeyed forth.’ He let the host have

3	

3	3	no rest, until the latter told him, that not far from thence stood a

3	

3	3	haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was,

3	

3	3	if he would but watch in it for three nights. The king had promised that

3	

3	3	he who would venture should have his daughter to wife, and she was the

3	

3	3	most beautiful maiden the sun shone on. Likewise in the castle lay great

3	

3	3	treasures, which were guarded by evil spirits, and these treasures would

3	

3	3	then be freed, and would make a poor man rich enough. Already many men

3	

3	3	had gone into the castle, but as yet none had come out again. Then the

3	

3	3	youth went next morning to the king, and said: ‘If it be allowed, I will

3	

3	3	willingly watch three nights in the haunted castle.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The king looked at him, and as the youth pleased him, he said: ‘You may

3	

3	3	ask for three things to take into the castle with you, but they must

3	

3	3	be things without life.’ Then he answered: ‘Then I ask for a fire, a

3	

3	3	turning lathe, and a cutting-board with the knife.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The king had these things carried into the castle for him during the

3	

3	3	day. When night was drawing near, the youth went up and made himself

3	

3	3	a bright fire in one of the rooms, placed the cutting-board and knife

3	

3	3	beside it, and seated himself by the turning-lathe. ‘Ah, if I could

3	

3	3	but shudder!’ said he, ‘but I shall not learn it here either.’ Towards

3	

3	3	midnight he was about to poke his fire, and as he was blowing it,

3	

3	3	something cried suddenly from one corner: ‘Au, miau! how cold we are!’

3	

3	3	‘You fools!’ cried he, ‘what are you crying about? If you are cold, come

3	

3	3	and take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves.’ And when he had said

3	

3	3	that, two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat down

3	

3	3	on each side of him, and looked savagely at him with their fiery

3	

3	3	eyes. After a short time, when they had warmed themselves, they said:

3	

3	3	‘Comrade, shall we have a game of cards?’ ‘Why not?’ he replied, ‘but

3	

3	3	just show me your paws.’ Then they stretched out their claws. ‘Oh,’ said

3	

3	3	he, ‘what long nails you have! Wait, I must first cut them for you.’

3	

3	3	Thereupon he seized them by the throats, put them on the cutting-board

3	

3	3	and screwed their feet fast. ‘I have looked at your fingers,’ said he,

3	

3	3	‘and my fancy for card-playing has gone,’ and he struck them dead and

3	

3	3	threw them out into the water. But when he had made away with these two,

3	

3	3	and was about to sit down again by his fire, out from every hole and

3	

3	3	corner came black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains, and more

3	

3	3	and more of them came until he could no longer move, and they yelled

3	

3	3	horribly, and got on his fire, pulled it to pieces, and tried to put

3	

3	3	it out. He watched them for a while quietly, but at last when they were

3	

3	3	going too far, he seized his cutting-knife, and cried: ‘Away with you,

3	

3	3	vermin,’ and began to cut them down. Some of them ran away, the others

3	

3	3	he killed, and threw out into the fish-pond. When he came back he fanned

3	

3	3	the embers of his fire again and warmed himself. And as he thus sat, his

3	

3	3	eyes would keep open no longer, and he felt a desire to sleep. Then he

3	

3	3	looked round and saw a great bed in the corner. ‘That is the very thing

3	

3	3	for me,’ said he, and got into it. When he was just going to shut his

3	

3	3	eyes, however, the bed began to move of its own accord, and went over

3	

3	3	the whole of the castle. ‘That’s right,’ said he, ‘but go faster.’ Then

3	

3	3	the bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it, up and down,

3	

3	3	over thresholds and stairs, but suddenly hop, hop, it turned over upside

3	

3	3	down, and lay on him like a mountain. But he threw quilts and pillows up

3	

3	3	in the air, got out and said: ‘Now anyone who likes, may drive,’ and

3	

3	3	lay down by his fire, and slept till it was day. In the morning the king

3	

3	3	came, and when he saw him lying there on the ground, he thought the evil

3	

3	3	spirits had killed him and he was dead. Then said he: ‘After all it is a

3	

3	3	pity,--for so handsome a man.’ The youth heard it, got up, and said: ‘It

3	

3	3	has not come to that yet.’ Then the king was astonished, but very glad,

3	

3	3	and asked how he had fared. ‘Very well indeed,’ answered he; ‘one

3	

3	3	night is past, the two others will pass likewise.’ Then he went to the

3	

3	3	innkeeper, who opened his eyes very wide, and said: ‘I never expected to

3	

3	3	see you alive again! Have you learnt how to shudder yet?’ ‘No,’ said he,

3	

3	3	‘it is all in vain. If someone would but tell me!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The second night he again went up into the old castle, sat down by the

3	

3	3	fire, and once more began his old song: ‘If I could but shudder!’ When

3	

3	3	midnight came, an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard; at

3	

3	3	first it was low, but it grew louder and louder. Then it was quiet for

3	

3	3	a while, and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down the

3	

3	3	chimney and fell before him. ‘Hullo!’ cried he, ‘another half belongs

3	

3	3	to this. This is not enough!’ Then the uproar began again, there was a

3	

3	3	roaring and howling, and the other half fell down likewise. ‘Wait,’ said

3	

3	3	he, ‘I will just stoke up the fire a little for you.’ When he had done

3	

3	3	that and looked round again, the two pieces were joined together, and a

3	

3	3	hideous man was sitting in his place. ‘That is no part of our bargain,’

3	

3	3	said the youth, ‘the bench is mine.’ The man wanted to push him away;

3	

3	3	the youth, however, would not allow that, but thrust him off with all

3	

3	3	his strength, and seated himself again in his own place. Then still more

3	

3	3	men fell down, one after the other; they brought nine dead men’s legs

3	

3	3	and two skulls, and set them up and played at nine-pins with them. The

3	

3	3	youth also wanted to play and said: ‘Listen you, can I join you?’ ‘Yes,

3	

3	3	if you have any money.’ ‘Money enough,’ replied he, ‘but your balls are

3	

3	3	not quite round.’ Then he took the skulls and put them in the lathe and

3	

3	3	turned them till they were round. ‘There, now they will roll better!’

3	

3	3	said he. ‘Hurrah! now we’ll have fun!’ He played with them and lost some

3	

3	3	of his money, but when it struck twelve, everything vanished from his

3	

3	3	sight. He lay down and quietly fell asleep. Next morning the king came

3	

3	3	to inquire after him. ‘How has it fared with you this time?’ asked he.

3	

3	3	‘I have been playing at nine-pins,’ he answered, ‘and have lost a couple

3	

3	3	of farthings.’ ‘Have you not shuddered then?’ ‘What?’ said he, ‘I have

3	

3	3	had a wonderful time! If I did but know what it was to shudder!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly:

3	

3	3	‘If I could but shudder.’ When it grew late, six tall men came in and

3	

3	3	brought a coffin. Then he said: ‘Ha, ha, that is certainly my little

3	

3	3	cousin, who died only a few days ago,’ and he beckoned with his finger,

3	

3	3	and cried: ‘Come, little cousin, come.’ They placed the coffin on the

3	

3	3	ground, but he went to it and took the lid off, and a dead man lay

3	

3	3	therein. He felt his face, but it was cold as ice. ‘Wait,’ said he, ‘I

3	

3	3	will warm you a little,’ and went to the fire and warmed his hand and

3	

3	3	laid it on the dead man’s face, but he remained cold. Then he took him

3	

3	3	out, and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbed his

3	

3	3	arms that the blood might circulate again. As this also did no good, he

3	

3	3	thought to himself: ‘When two people lie in bed together, they warm each

3	

3	3	other,’ and carried him to the bed, covered him over and lay down by

3	

3	3	him. After a short time the dead man became warm too, and began to move.

3	

3	3	Then said the youth, ‘See, little cousin, have I not warmed you?’ The

3	

3	3	dead man, however, got up and cried: ‘Now will I strangle you.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘What!’ said he, ‘is that the way you thank me? You shall at once go

3	

3	3	into your coffin again,’ and he took him up, threw him into it, and shut

3	

3	3	the lid. Then came the six men and carried him away again. ‘I cannot

3	

3	3	manage to shudder,’ said he. ‘I shall never learn it here as long as I

3	

3	3	live.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then a man entered who was taller than all others, and looked terrible.

3	

3	3	He was old, however, and had a long white beard. ‘You wretch,’ cried he,

3	

3	3	‘you shall soon learn what it is to shudder, for you shall die.’ ‘Not so

3	

3	3	fast,’ replied the youth. ‘If I am to die, I shall have to have a say

3	

3	3	in it.’ ‘I will soon seize you,’ said the fiend. ‘Softly, softly, do not

3	

3	3	talk so big. I am as strong as you are, and perhaps even stronger.’

3	

3	3	‘We shall see,’ said the old man. ‘If you are stronger, I will let you

3	

3	3	go--come, we will try.’ Then he led him by dark passages to a smith’s

3	

3	3	forge, took an axe, and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground.

3	

3	3	‘I can do better than that,’ said the youth, and went to the other

3	

3	3	anvil. The old man placed himself near and wanted to look on, and his

3	

3	3	white beard hung down. Then the youth seized the axe, split the anvil

3	

3	3	with one blow, and in it caught the old man’s beard. ‘Now I have you,’

3	

3	3	said the youth. ‘Now it is your turn to die.’ Then he seized an iron bar

3	

3	3	and beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop, when he

3	

3	3	would give him great riches. The youth drew out the axe and let him go.

3	

3	3	The old man led him back into the castle, and in a cellar showed him

3	

3	3	three chests full of gold. ‘Of these,’ said he, ‘one part is for the

3	

3	3	poor, the other for the king, the third yours.’ In the meantime it

3	

3	3	struck twelve, and the spirit disappeared, so that the youth stood in

3	

3	3	darkness. ‘I shall still be able to find my way out,’ said he, and felt

3	

3	3	about, found the way into the room, and slept there by his fire.

3	

3	3	Next morning the king came and said: ‘Now you must have learnt what

3	

3	3	shuddering is?’ ‘No,’ he answered; ‘what can it be? My dead cousin was

3	

3	3	here, and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money down

3	

3	3	below, but no one told me what it was to shudder.’ ‘Then,’ said the

3	

3	3	king, ‘you have saved the castle, and shall marry my daughter.’ ‘That

3	

3	3	is all very well,’ said he, ‘but still I do not know what it is to

3	

3	3	shudder!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated; but howsoever

3	

3	3	much the young king loved his wife, and however happy he was, he still

3	

3	3	said always: ‘If I could but shudder--if I could but shudder.’ And this

3	

3	3	at last angered her. Her waiting-maid said: ‘I will find a cure for him;

3	

3	3	he shall soon learn what it is to shudder.’ She went out to the stream

3	

3	3	which flowed through the garden, and had a whole bucketful of gudgeons

3	

3	3	brought to her. At night when the young king was sleeping, his wife was

3	

3	3	to draw the clothes off him and empty the bucket full of cold water

3	

3	3	with the gudgeons in it over him, so that the little fishes would

3	

3	3	sprawl about him. Then he woke up and cried: ‘Oh, what makes me shudder

3	

3	3	so?--what makes me shudder so, dear wife? Ah! now I know what it is to

3	

3	3	shudder!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	KING GRISLY-BEARD

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	A great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was very

3	

3	3	beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of the

3	

3	3	princes who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her, and she

3	

3	3	only made sport of them.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Once upon a time the king held a great feast, and asked thither all

3	

3	3	her suitors; and they all sat in a row, ranged according to their

3	

3	3	rank--kings, and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons,

3	

3	3	and knights. Then the princess came in, and as she passed by them she

3	

3	3	had something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat: ‘He’s

3	

3	3	as round as a tub,’ said she. The next was too tall: ‘What a maypole!’

3	

3	3	said she. The next was too short: ‘What a dumpling!’ said she. The

3	

3	3	fourth was too pale, and she called him ‘Wallface.’ The fifth was too

3	

3	3	red, so she called him ‘Coxcomb.’ The sixth was not straight enough;

3	

3	3	so she said he was like a green stick, that had been laid to dry over

3	

3	3	a baker’s oven. And thus she had some joke to crack upon every one: but

3	

3	3	she laughed more than all at a good king who was there. ‘Look at

3	

3	3	him,’ said she; ‘his beard is like an old mop; he shall be called

3	

3	3	Grisly-beard.’ So the king got the nickname of Grisly-beard.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved,

3	

3	3	and how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or

3	

3	3	unwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that

3	

3	3	came to the door.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Two days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play

3	

3	3	under the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said,

3	

3	3	‘Let him come in.’ So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when

3	

3	3	he had sung before the king and the princess, he begged a boon. Then the

3	

3	3	king said, ‘You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for

3	

3	3	your wife.’ The princess begged and prayed; but the king said, ‘I have

3	

3	3	sworn to give you to the first comer, and I will keep my word.’ So words

3	

3	3	and tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married

3	

3	3	to the fiddler. When this was over the king said, ‘Now get ready to

3	

3	3	go--you must not stay here--you must travel on with your husband.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the fiddler went his way, and took her with him, and they soon came

3	

3	3	to a great wood. ‘Pray,’ said she, ‘whose is this wood?’ ‘It belongs

3	

3	3	to King Grisly-beard,’ answered he; ‘hadst thou taken him, all had been

3	

3	3	thine.’ ‘Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘would that I had

3	

3	3	married King Grisly-beard!’ Next they came to some fine meadows. ‘Whose

3	

3	3	are these beautiful green meadows?’ said she. ‘They belong to King

3	

3	3	Grisly-beard, hadst thou taken him, they had all been thine.’ ‘Ah!

3	

3	3	unlucky wretch that I am!’ said she; ‘would that I had married King

3	

3	3	Grisly-beard!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then they came to a great city. ‘Whose is this noble city?’ said she.

3	

3	3	‘It belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all been

3	

3	3	thine.’ ‘Ah! wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘why did I not marry King

3	

3	3	Grisly-beard?’ ‘That is no business of mine,’ said the fiddler: ‘why

3	

3	3	should you wish for another husband? Am not I good enough for you?’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	At last they came to a small cottage. ‘What a paltry place!’ said she;

3	

3	3	‘to whom does that little dirty hole belong?’ Then the fiddler said,

3	

3	3	‘That is your and my house, where we are to live.’ ‘Where are your

3	

3	3	servants?’ cried she. ‘What do we want with servants?’ said he; ‘you

3	

3	3	must do for yourself whatever is to be done. Now make the fire, and put

3	

3	3	on water and cook my supper, for I am very tired.’ But the princess knew

3	

3	3	nothing of making fires and cooking, and the fiddler was forced to help

3	

3	3	her. When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the

3	

3	3	fiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house. Thus

3	

3	3	they lived for two days: and when they had eaten up all there was in the

3	

3	3	cottage, the man said, ‘Wife, we can’t go on thus, spending money and

3	

3	3	earning nothing. You must learn to weave baskets.’ Then he went out and

3	

3	3	cut willows, and brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made

3	

3	3	her fingers very sore. ‘I see this work won’t do,’ said he: ‘try and

3	

3	3	spin; perhaps you will do that better.’ So she sat down and tried to

3	

3	3	spin; but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran. ‘See

3	

3	3	now,’ said the fiddler, ‘you are good for nothing; you can do no work:

3	

3	3	what a bargain I have got! However, I’ll try and set up a trade in pots

3	

3	3	and pans, and you shall stand in the market and sell them.’ ‘Alas!’

3	

3	3	sighed she, ‘if any of my father’s court should pass by and see me

3	

3	3	standing in the market, how they will laugh at me!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if she

3	

3	3	did not wish to die of hunger. At first the trade went well; for many

3	

3	3	people, seeing such a beautiful woman, went to buy her wares, and paid

3	

3	3	their money without thinking of taking away the goods. They lived on

3	

3	3	this as long as it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of

3	

3	3	ware, and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market; but

3	

3	3	a drunken soldier soon came by, and rode his horse against her stall,

3	

3	3	and broke all her goods into a thousand pieces. Then she began to cry,

3	

3	3	and knew not what to do. ‘Ah! what will become of me?’ said she; ‘what

3	

3	3	will my husband say?’ So she ran home and told him all. ‘Who would

3	

3	3	have thought you would have been so silly,’ said he, ‘as to put an

3	

3	3	earthenware stall in the corner of the market, where everybody passes?

3	

3	3	but let us have no more crying; I see you are not fit for this sort of

3	

3	3	work, so I have been to the king’s palace, and asked if they did not

3	

3	3	want a kitchen-maid; and they say they will take you, and there you will

3	

3	3	have plenty to eat.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Thus the princess became a kitchen-maid, and helped the cook to do all

3	

3	3	the dirtiest work; but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat

3	

3	3	that was left, and on this they lived.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	She had not been there long before she heard that the king’s eldest son

3	

3	3	was passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the windows

3	

3	3	and looked out. Everything was ready, and all the pomp and brightness of

3	

3	3	the court was there. Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly

3	

3	3	which had brought her so low. And the servants gave her some of the rich

3	

3	3	meats, which she put into her basket to take home.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	All on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king’s son in golden

3	

3	3	clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her

3	

3	3	by the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she

3	

3	3	trembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was

3	

3	3	making sport of her. However, he kept fast hold, and led her in; and the

3	

3	3	cover of the basket came off, so that the meats in it fell about. Then

3	

3	3	everybody laughed and jeered at her; and she was so abashed, that she

3	

3	3	wished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth. She sprang to the

3	

3	3	door to run away; but on the steps King Grisly-beard overtook her, and

3	

3	3	brought her back and said, ‘Fear me not! I am the fiddler who has lived

3	

3	3	with you in the hut. I brought you there because I really loved you. I

3	

3	3	am also the soldier that overset your stall. I have done all this only

3	

3	3	to cure you of your silly pride, and to show you the folly of your

3	

3	3	ill-treatment of me. Now all is over: you have learnt wisdom, and it is

3	

3	3	time to hold our marriage feast.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes; and

3	

3	3	her father and his whole court were there already, and welcomed her home

3	

3	3	on her marriage. Joy was in every face and every heart. The feast was

3	

3	3	grand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish that you

3	

3	3	and I had been of the party.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	IRON HANS

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There was once upon a time a king who had a great forest near his

3	

3	3	palace, full of all kinds of wild animals. One day he sent out a

3	

3	3	huntsman to shoot him a roe, but he did not come back. ‘Perhaps some

3	

3	3	accident has befallen him,’ said the king, and the next day he sent out

3	

3	3	two more huntsmen who were to search for him, but they too stayed away.

3	

3	3	Then on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said: ‘Scour

3	

3	3	the whole forest through, and do not give up until you have found all

3	

3	3	three.’ But of these also, none came home again, none were seen again.

3	

3	3	From that time forth, no one would any longer venture into the forest,

3	

3	3	and it lay there in deep stillness and solitude, and nothing was seen

3	

3	3	of it, but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it. This lasted for

3	

3	3	many years, when an unknown huntsman announced himself to the king as

3	

3	3	seeking a situation, and offered to go into the dangerous forest. The

3	

3	3	king, however, would not give his consent, and said: ‘It is not safe in

3	

3	3	there; I fear it would fare with you no better than with the others,

3	

3	3	and you would never come out again.’ The huntsman replied: ‘Lord, I will

3	

3	3	venture it at my own risk, of fear I know nothing.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest. It was

3	

3	3	not long before the dog fell in with some game on the way, and wanted to

3	

3	3	pursue it; but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before a

3	

3	3	deep pool, could go no farther, and a naked arm stretched itself out of

3	

3	3	the water, seized it, and drew it under. When the huntsman saw that, he

3	

3	3	went back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out the

3	

3	3	water. When they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body

3	

3	3	was brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his

3	

3	3	knees. They bound him with cords, and led him away to the castle. There

3	

3	3	was great astonishment over the wild man; the king, however, had him put

3	

3	3	in an iron cage in his courtyard, and forbade the door to be opened

3	

3	3	on pain of death, and the queen herself was to take the key into her

3	

3	3	keeping. And from this time forth everyone could again go into the

3	

3	3	forest with safety.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The king had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the

3	

3	3	courtyard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the cage.

3	

3	3	The boy ran thither and said: ‘Give me my ball out.’ ‘Not till you have

3	

3	3	opened the door for me,’ answered the man. ‘No,’ said the boy, ‘I will

3	

3	3	not do that; the king has forbidden it,’ and ran away. The next day he

3	

3	3	again went and asked for his ball; the wild man said: ‘Open my door,’

3	

3	3	but the boy would not. On the third day the king had ridden out hunting,

3	

3	3	and the boy went once more and said: ‘I cannot open the door even if I

3	

3	3	wished, for I have not the key.’ Then the wild man said: ‘It lies under

3	

3	3	your mother’s pillow, you can get it there.’ The boy, who wanted to have

3	

3	3	his ball back, cast all thought to the winds, and brought the key. The

3	

3	3	door opened with difficulty, and the boy pinched his fingers. When it

3	

3	3	was open the wild man stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried

3	

3	3	away. The boy had become afraid; he called and cried after him: ‘Oh,

3	

3	3	wild man, do not go away, or I shall be beaten!’ The wild man turned

3	

3	3	back, took him up, set him on his shoulder, and went with hasty steps

3	

3	3	into the forest. When the king came home, he observed the empty cage,

3	

3	3	and asked the queen how that had happened. She knew nothing about it,

3	

3	3	and sought the key, but it was gone. She called the boy, but no one

3	

3	3	answered. The king sent out people to seek for him in the fields, but

3	

3	3	they did not find him. Then he could easily guess what had happened, and

3	

3	3	much grief reigned in the royal court.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he took the boy

3	

3	3	down from his shoulder, and said to him: ‘You will never see your father

3	

3	3	and mother again, but I will keep you with me, for you have set me free,

3	

3	3	and I have compassion on you. If you do all I bid you, you shall fare

3	

3	3	well. Of treasure and gold have I enough, and more than anyone in the

3	

3	3	world.’ He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept, and the

3	

3	3	next morning the man took him to a well, and said: ‘Behold, the gold

3	

3	3	well is as bright and clear as crystal, you shall sit beside it, and

3	

3	3	take care that nothing falls into it, or it will be polluted. I will

3	

3	3	come every evening to see if you have obeyed my order.’ The boy placed

3	

3	3	himself by the brink of the well, and often saw a golden fish or a

3	

3	3	golden snake show itself therein, and took care that nothing fell in.

3	

3	3	As he was thus sitting, his finger hurt him so violently that he

3	

3	3	involuntarily put it in the water. He drew it quickly out again, but saw

3	

3	3	that it was quite gilded, and whatsoever pains he took to wash the gold

3	

3	3	off again, all was to no purpose. In the evening Iron Hans came back,

3	

3	3	looked at the boy, and said: ‘What has happened to the well?’ ‘Nothing

3	

3	3	nothing,’ he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that the

3	

3	3	man might not see it. But he said: ‘You have dipped your finger into

3	

3	3	the water, this time it may pass, but take care you do not again let

3	

3	3	anything go in.’ By daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and

3	

3	3	watching it. His finger hurt him again and he passed it over his head,

3	

3	3	and then unhappily a hair fell down into the well. He took it quickly

3	

3	3	out, but it was already quite gilded. Iron Hans came, and already knew

3	

3	3	what had happened. ‘You have let a hair fall into the well,’ said he.

3	

3	3	‘I will allow you to watch by it once more, but if this happens for the

3	

3	3	third time then the well is polluted and you can no longer remain with

3	

3	3	me.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	On the third day, the boy sat by the well, and did not stir his finger,

3	

3	3	however much it hurt him. But the time was long to him, and he looked at

3	

3	3	the reflection of his face on the surface of the water. And as he

3	

3	3	still bent down more and more while he was doing so, and trying to look

3	

3	3	straight into the eyes, his long hair fell down from his shoulders into

3	

3	3	the water. He raised himself up quickly, but the whole of the hair of

3	

3	3	his head was already golden and shone like the sun. You can imagine how

3	

3	3	terrified the poor boy was! He took his pocket-handkerchief and tied it

3	

3	3	round his head, in order that the man might not see it. When he came he

3	

3	3	already knew everything, and said: ‘Take the handkerchief off.’ Then the

3	

3	3	golden hair streamed forth, and let the boy excuse himself as he might,

3	

3	3	it was of no use. ‘You have not stood the trial and can stay here no

3	

3	3	longer. Go forth into the world, there you will learn what poverty is.

3	

3	3	But as you have not a bad heart, and as I mean well by you, there is

3	

3	3	one thing I will grant you; if you fall into any difficulty, come to the

3	

3	3	forest and cry: “Iron Hans,” and then I will come and help you. My

3	

3	3	power is great, greater than you think, and I have gold and silver in

3	

3	3	abundance.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then the king’s son left the forest, and walked by beaten and unbeaten

3	

3	3	paths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city. There he

3	

3	3	looked for work, but could find none, and he learnt nothing by which he

3	

3	3	could help himself. At length he went to the palace, and asked if they

3	

3	3	would take him in. The people about court did not at all know what use

3	

3	3	they could make of him, but they liked him, and told him to stay. At

3	

3	3	length the cook took him into his service, and said he might carry wood

3	

3	3	and water, and rake the cinders together. Once when it so happened that

3	

3	3	no one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the food to the

3	

3	3	royal table, but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen, he

3	

3	3	kept his little cap on. Such a thing as that had never yet come under

3	

3	3	the king’s notice, and he said: ‘When you come to the royal table you

3	

3	3	must take your hat off.’ He answered: ‘Ah, Lord, I cannot; I have a bad

3	

3	3	sore place on my head.’ Then the king had the cook called before him

3	

3	3	and scolded him, and asked how he could take such a boy as that into his

3	

3	3	service; and that he was to send him away at once. The cook, however,

3	

3	3	had pity on him, and exchanged him for the gardener’s boy.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	And now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and bear

3	

3	3	the wind and bad weather. Once in summer when he was working alone in

3	

3	3	the garden, the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the air

3	

3	3	might cool him. As the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so

3	

3	3	that the rays fell into the bedroom of the king’s daughter, and up she

3	

3	3	sprang to see what that could be. Then she saw the boy, and cried to

3	

3	3	him: ‘Boy, bring me a wreath of flowers.’ He put his cap on with all

3	

3	3	haste, and gathered wild field-flowers and bound them together. When he

3	

3	3	was ascending the stairs with them, the gardener met him, and said: ‘How

3	

3	3	can you take the king’s daughter a garland of such common flowers? Go

3	

3	3	quickly, and get another, and seek out the prettiest and rarest.’ ‘Oh,

3	

3	3	no,’ replied the boy, ‘the wild ones have more scent, and will please

3	

3	3	her better.’ When he got into the room, the king’s daughter said: ‘Take

3	

3	3	your cap off, it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence.’ He again

3	

3	3	said: ‘I may not, I have a sore head.’ She, however, caught at his

3	

3	3	cap and pulled it off, and then his golden hair rolled down on his

3	

3	3	shoulders, and it was splendid to behold. He wanted to run out, but she

3	

3	3	held him by the arm, and gave him a handful of ducats. With these he

3	

3	3	departed, but he cared nothing for the gold pieces. He took them to the

3	

3	3	gardener, and said: ‘I present them to your children, they can play with

3	

3	3	them.’ The following day the king’s daughter again called to him that he

3	

3	3	was to bring her a wreath of field-flowers, and then he went in with it,

3	

3	3	she instantly snatched at his cap, and wanted to take it away from him,

3	

3	3	but he held it fast with both hands. She again gave him a handful of

3	

3	3	ducats, but he would not keep them, and gave them to the gardener for

3	

3	3	playthings for his children. On the third day things went just the

3	

3	3	same; she could not get his cap away from him, and he would not have her

3	

3	3	money.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Not long afterwards, the country was overrun by war. The king gathered

3	

3	3	together his people, and did not know whether or not he could offer any

3	

3	3	opposition to the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a mighty

3	

3	3	army. Then said the gardener’s boy: ‘I am grown up, and will go to the

3	

3	3	wars also, only give me a horse.’ The others laughed, and said: ‘Seek

3	

3	3	one for yourself when we are gone, we will leave one behind us in the

3	

3	3	stable for you.’ When they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and

3	

3	3	led the horse out; it was lame of one foot, and limped hobblety jib,

3	

3	3	hobblety jib; nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away to the dark

3	

3	3	forest. When he came to the outskirts, he called ‘Iron Hans’ three

3	

3	3	times so loudly that it echoed through the trees. Thereupon the wild man

3	

3	3	appeared immediately, and said: ‘What do you desire?’ ‘I want a strong

3	

3	3	steed, for I am going to the wars.’ ‘That you shall have, and still more

3	

3	3	than you ask for.’ Then the wild man went back into the forest, and it

3	

3	3	was not long before a stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that

3	

3	3	snorted with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained, and behind

3	

3	3	them followed a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron, and

3	

3	3	their swords flashed in the sun. The youth made over his three-legged

3	

3	3	horse to the stable-boy, mounted the other, and rode at the head of the

3	

3	3	soldiers. When he got near the battlefield a great part of the king’s

3	

3	3	men had already fallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give

3	

3	3	way. Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers, broke like

3	

3	3	a hurricane over the enemy, and beat down all who opposed him. They

3	

3	3	began to flee, but the youth pursued, and never stopped, until there

3	

3	3	was not a single man left. Instead of returning to the king, however, he

3	

3	3	conducted his troop by byways back to the forest, and called forth Iron

3	

3	3	Hans. ‘What do you desire?’ asked the wild man. ‘Take back your horse

3	

3	3	and your troops, and give me my three-legged horse again.’ All that he

3	

3	3	asked was done, and soon he was riding on his three-legged horse. When

3	

3	3	the king returned to his palace, his daughter went to meet him, and

3	

3	3	wished him joy of his victory. ‘I am not the one who carried away the

3	

3	3	victory,’ said he, ‘but a strange knight who came to my assistance with

3	

3	3	his soldiers.’ The daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight was,

3	

3	3	but the king did not know, and said: ‘He followed the enemy, and I did

3	

3	3	not see him again.’ She inquired of the gardener where his boy was, but

3	

3	3	he smiled, and said: ‘He has just come home on his three-legged horse,

3	

3	3	and the others have been mocking him, and crying: “Here comes our

3	

3	3	hobblety jib back again!” They asked, too: “Under what hedge have you

3	

3	3	been lying sleeping all the time?” So he said: “I did the best of all,

3	

3	3	and it would have gone badly without me.” And then he was still more

3	

3	3	ridiculed.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The king said to his daughter: ‘I will proclaim a great feast that shall

3	

3	3	last for three days, and you shall throw a golden apple. Perhaps the

3	

3	3	unknown man will show himself.’ When the feast was announced, the youth

3	

3	3	went out to the forest, and called Iron Hans. ‘What do you desire?’

3	

3	3	asked he. ‘That I may catch the king’s daughter’s golden apple.’ ‘It is

3	

3	3	as safe as if you had it already,’ said Iron Hans. ‘You shall likewise

3	

3	3	have a suit of red armour for the occasion, and ride on a spirited

3	

3	3	chestnut-horse.’ When the day came, the youth galloped to the spot, took

3	

3	3	his place amongst the knights, and was recognized by no one. The king’s

3	

3	3	daughter came forward, and threw a golden apple to the knights, but none

3	

3	3	of them caught it but he, only as soon as he had it he galloped away.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	On the second day Iron Hans equipped him as a white knight, and gave him

3	

3	3	a white horse. Again he was the only one who caught the apple, and

3	

3	3	he did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it. The king grew

3	

3	3	angry, and said: ‘That is not allowed; he must appear before me and tell

3	

3	3	his name.’ He gave the order that if the knight who caught the apple,

3	

3	3	should go away again they should pursue him, and if he would not come

3	

3	3	back willingly, they were to cut him down and stab him.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	On the third day, he received from Iron Hans a suit of black armour and

3	

3	3	a black horse, and again he caught the apple. But when he was riding off

3	

3	3	with it, the king’s attendants pursued him, and one of them got so near

3	

3	3	him that he wounded the youth’s leg with the point of his sword. The

3	

3	3	youth nevertheless escaped from them, but his horse leapt so violently

3	

3	3	that the helmet fell from the youth’s head, and they could see that he

3	

3	3	had golden hair. They rode back and announced this to the king.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The following day the king’s daughter asked the gardener about his

3	

3	3	boy. ‘He is at work in the garden; the queer creature has been at the

3	

3	3	festival too, and only came home yesterday evening; he has likewise

3	

3	3	shown my children three golden apples which he has won.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The king had him summoned into his presence, and he came and again had

3	

3	3	his little cap on his head. But the king’s daughter went up to him and

3	

3	3	took it off, and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders, and

3	

3	3	he was so handsome that all were amazed. ‘Are you the knight who came

3	

3	3	every day to the festival, always in different colours, and who caught

3	

3	3	the three golden apples?’ asked the king. ‘Yes,’ answered he, ‘and here

3	

3	3	the apples are,’ and he took them out of his pocket, and returned them

3	

3	3	to the king. ‘If you desire further proof, you may see the wound which

3	

3	3	your people gave me when they followed me. But I am likewise the knight

3	

3	3	who helped you to your victory over your enemies.’ ‘If you can perform

3	

3	3	such deeds as that, you are no gardener’s boy; tell me, who is your

3	

3	3	father?’ ‘My father is a mighty king, and gold have I in plenty as great

3	

3	3	as I require.’ ‘I well see,’ said the king, ‘that I owe my thanks to

3	

3	3	you; can I do anything to please you?’ ‘Yes,’ answered he, ‘that indeed

3	

3	3	you can. Give me your daughter to wife.’ The maiden laughed, and said:

3	

3	3	‘He does not stand much on ceremony, but I have already seen by his

3	

3	3	golden hair that he was no gardener’s boy,’ and then she went and

3	

3	3	kissed him. His father and mother came to the wedding, and were in great

3	

3	3	delight, for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear

3	

3	3	son again. And as they were sitting at the marriage-feast, the music

3	

3	3	suddenly stopped, the doors opened, and a stately king came in with a

3	

3	3	great retinue. He went up to the youth, embraced him and said: ‘I am

3	

3	3	Iron Hans, and was by enchantment a wild man, but you have set me free;

3	

3	3	all the treasures which I possess, shall be your property.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	CAT-SKIN

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There was once a king, whose queen had hair of the purest gold, and was

3	

3	3	so beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole face of

3	

3	3	the earth. But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she felt that her

3	

3	3	end drew near she called the king to her and said, ‘Promise me that you

3	

3	3	will never marry again, unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful

3	

3	3	as I am, and who has golden hair like mine.’ Then when the king in his

3	

3	3	grief promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died. But the king

3	

3	3	was not to be comforted, and for a long time never thought of taking

3	

3	3	another wife. At last, however, his wise men said, ‘this will not do;

3	

3	3	the king must marry again, that we may have a queen.’ So messengers were

3	

3	3	sent far and wide, to seek for a bride as beautiful as the late queen.

3	

3	3	But there was no princess in the world so beautiful; and if there had

3	

3	3	been, still there was not one to be found who had golden hair. So the

3	

3	3	messengers came home, and had had all their trouble for nothing.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Now the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother,

3	

3	3	and had the same golden hair. And when she was grown up, the king looked

3	

3	3	at her and saw that she was just like this late queen: then he said to

3	

3	3	his courtiers, ‘May I not marry my daughter? She is the very image of my

3	

3	3	dead wife: unless I have her, I shall not find any bride upon the whole

3	

3	3	earth, and you say there must be a queen.’ When the courtiers heard this

3	

3	3	they were shocked, and said, ‘Heaven forbid that a father should marry

3	

3	3	his daughter! Out of so great a sin no good can come.’ And his daughter

3	

3	3	was also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts;

3	

3	3	so she said to him, ‘Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses:

3	

3	3	one must be of gold, like the sun; another must be of shining silver,

3	

3	3	like the moon; and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this,

3	

3	3	I want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to

3	

3	3	which every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin.’ And thus

3	

3	3	she thought he would think of the matter no more. But the king made the

3	

3	3	most skilful workmen in his kingdom weave the three dresses: one golden,

3	

3	3	like the sun; another silvery, like the moon; and a third sparkling,

3	

3	3	like the stars: and his hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in

3	

3	3	his kingdom, and to take the finest fur out of their skins: and thus a

3	

3	3	mantle of a thousand furs was made.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When all were ready, the king sent them to her; but she got up in the

3	

3	3	night when all were asleep, and took three of her trinkets, a golden

3	

3	3	ring, a golden necklace, and a golden brooch, and packed the three

3	

3	3	dresses--of the sun, the moon, and the stars--up in a nutshell, and

3	

3	3	wrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur, and besmeared

3	

3	3	her face and hands with soot. Then she threw herself upon Heaven for

3	

3	3	help in her need, and went away, and journeyed on the whole night, till

3	

3	3	at last she came to a large wood. As she was very tired, she sat herself

3	

3	3	down in the hollow of a tree and soon fell asleep: and there she slept

3	

3	3	on till it was midday.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Now as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it, his dogs

3	

3	3	came to the tree, and began to snuff about, and run round and round, and

3	

3	3	bark. ‘Look sharp!’ said the king to the huntsmen, ‘and see what sort

3	

3	3	of game lies there.’ And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and when they

3	

3	3	came back again said, ‘In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful

3	

3	3	beast, such as we never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand

3	

3	3	kinds of fur, but there it lies fast asleep.’ ‘See,’ said the king, ‘if

3	

3	3	you can catch it alive, and we will take it with us.’ So the huntsmen

3	

3	3	took it up, and the maiden awoke and was greatly frightened, and said,

3	

3	3	‘I am a poor child that has neither father nor mother left; have pity on

3	

3	3	me and take me with you.’ Then they said, ‘Yes, Miss Cat-skin, you will

3	

3	3	do for the kitchen; you can sweep up the ashes, and do things of that

3	

3	3	sort.’ So they put her into the coach, and took her home to the king’s

3	

3	3	palace. Then they showed her a little corner under the staircase, where

3	

3	3	no light of day ever peeped in, and said, ‘Cat-skin, you may lie and

3	

3	3	sleep there.’ And she was sent into the kitchen, and made to fetch wood

3	

3	3	and water, to blow the fire, pluck the poultry, pick the herbs, sift the

3	

3	3	ashes, and do all the dirty work.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Thus Cat-skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully. ‘Ah! pretty

3	

3	3	princess!’ thought she, ‘what will now become of thee?’ But it happened

3	

3	3	one day that a feast was to be held in the king’s castle, so she said to

3	

3	3	the cook, ‘May I go up a little while and see what is going on? I will

3	

3	3	take care and stand behind the door.’ And the cook said, ‘Yes, you may

3	

3	3	go, but be back again in half an hour’s time, to rake out the ashes.’

3	

3	3	Then she took her little lamp, and went into her cabin, and took off the

3	

3	3	fur skin, and washed the soot from off her face and hands, so that her

3	

3	3	beauty shone forth like the sun from behind the clouds. She next opened

3	

3	3	her nutshell, and brought out of it the dress that shone like the sun,

3	

3	3	and so went to the feast. Everyone made way for her, for nobody knew

3	

3	3	her, and they thought she could be no less than a king’s daughter. But

3	

3	3	the king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and

3	

3	3	he thought in his heart, ‘I never saw any one half so beautiful.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked

3	

3	3	round for her, she was gone, no one knew wither. The guards that stood

3	

3	3	at the castle gate were called in: but they had seen no one. The truth

3	

3	3	was, that she had run into her little cabin, pulled off her dress,

3	

3	3	blackened her face and hands, put on the fur-skin cloak, and was

3	

3	3	Cat-skin again. When she went into the kitchen to her work, and began

3	

3	3	to rake the ashes, the cook said, ‘Let that alone till the morning, and

3	

3	3	heat the king’s soup; I should like to run up now and give a peep: but

3	

3	3	take care you don’t let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of

3	

3	3	never eating again.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	As soon as the cook went away, Cat-skin heated the king’s soup, and

3	

3	3	toasted a slice of bread first, as nicely as ever she could; and when it

3	

3	3	was ready, she went and looked in the cabin for her little golden ring,

3	

3	3	and put it into the dish in which the soup was. When the dance was over,

3	

3	3	the king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well,

3	

3	3	that he thought he had never tasted any so good before. At the bottom

3	

3	3	he saw a gold ring lying; and as he could not make out how it had got

3	

3	3	there, he ordered the cook to be sent for. The cook was frightened when

3	

3	3	he heard the order, and said to Cat-skin, ‘You must have let a hair fall

3	

3	3	into the soup; if it be so, you will have a good beating.’ Then he went

3	

3	3	before the king, and he asked him who had cooked the soup. ‘I did,’

3	

3	3	answered the cook. But the king said, ‘That is not true; it was better

3	

3	3	done than you could do it.’ Then he answered, ‘To tell the truth I did

3	

3	3	not cook it, but Cat-skin did.’ ‘Then let Cat-skin come up,’ said the

3	

3	3	king: and when she came he said to her, ‘Who are you?’ ‘I am a poor

3	

3	3	child,’ said she, ‘that has lost both father and mother.’ ‘How came you

3	

3	3	in my palace?’ asked he. ‘I am good for nothing,’ said she, ‘but to be

3	

3	3	scullion-girl, and to have boots and shoes thrown at my head.’ ‘But how

3	

3	3	did you get the ring that was in the soup?’ asked the king. Then she

3	

3	3	would not own that she knew anything about the ring; so the king sent

3	

3	3	her away again about her business.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	After a time there was another feast, and Cat-skin asked the cook to let

3	

3	3	her go up and see it as before. ‘Yes,’ said he, ‘but come again in half

3	

3	3	an hour, and cook the king the soup that he likes so much.’ Then she

3	

3	3	ran to her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her dress

3	

3	3	out which was silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she went in,

3	

3	3	looking like a king’s daughter, the king went up to her, and rejoiced at

3	

3	3	seeing her again, and when the dance began he danced with her. After the

3	

3	3	dance was at an end she managed to slip out, so slyly that the king did

3	

3	3	not see where she was gone; but she sprang into her little cabin, and

3	

3	3	made herself into Cat-skin again, and went into the kitchen to cook the

3	

3	3	soup. Whilst the cook was above stairs, she got the golden necklace and

3	

3	3	dropped it into the soup; then it was brought to the king, who ate it,

3	

3	3	and it pleased him as well as before; so he sent for the cook, who

3	

3	3	was again forced to tell him that Cat-skin had cooked it. Cat-skin was

3	

3	3	brought again before the king, but she still told him that she was only

3	

3	3	fit to have boots and shoes thrown at her head.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	But when the king had ordered a feast to be got ready for the third

3	

3	3	time, it happened just the same as before. ‘You must be a witch,

3	

3	3	Cat-skin,’ said the cook; ‘for you always put something into your soup,

3	

3	3	so that it pleases the king better than mine.’ However, he let her go up

3	

3	3	as before. Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars, and

3	

3	3	went into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again, and

3	

3	3	thought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then. So whilst

3	

3	3	he was dancing with her, he put a gold ring on her finger without her

3	

3	3	seeing it, and ordered that the dance should be kept up a long time.

3	

3	3	When it was at an end, he would have held her fast by the hand, but she

3	

3	3	slipped away, and sprang so quickly through the crowd that he lost sight

3	

3	3	of her: and she ran as fast as she could into her little cabin under

3	

3	3	the stairs. But this time she kept away too long, and stayed beyond the

3	

3	3	half-hour; so she had not time to take off her fine dress, and threw her

3	

3	3	fur mantle over it, and in her haste did not blacken herself all over

3	

3	3	with soot, but left one of her fingers white.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then she ran into the kitchen, and cooked the king’s soup; and as soon

3	

3	3	as the cook was gone, she put the golden brooch into the dish. When the

3	

3	3	king got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and

3	

3	3	soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst

3	

3	3	they were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and

3	

3	3	when she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off

3	

3	3	a little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Then he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and

3	

3	3	beautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so she

3	

3	3	washed the soot and ashes from her face, and showed herself to be the

3	

3	3	most beautiful princess upon the face of the earth. But the king said,

3	

3	3	‘You are my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each

3	

3	3	other.’ And the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as ever

3	

3	3	was heard of or seen in that country, or indeed in any other.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	SNOW-WHITE AND ROSE-RED

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	There was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage. In front of

3	

3	3	the cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which bore

3	

3	3	white and the other red roses. She had two children who were like the

3	

3	3	two rose-trees, and one was called Snow-white, and the other Rose-red.

3	

3	3	They were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two children

3	

3	3	in the world were, only Snow-white was more quiet and gentle than

3	

3	3	Rose-red. Rose-red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields

3	

3	3	seeking flowers and catching butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home

3	

3	3	with her mother, and helped her with her housework, or read to her when

3	

3	3	there was nothing to do.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The two children were so fond of one another that they always held each

3	

3	3	other by the hand when they went out together, and when Snow-white said:

3	

3	3	‘We will not leave each other,’ Rose-red answered: ‘Never so long as we

3	

3	3	live,’ and their mother would add: ‘What one has she must share with the

3	

3	3	other.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	They often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries, and no

3	

3	3	beasts did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully. The little

3	

3	3	hare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands, the roe grazed by

3	

3	3	their side, the stag leapt merrily by them, and the birds sat still upon

3	

3	3	the boughs, and sang whatever they knew.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	No mishap overtook them; if they had stayed too late in the forest, and

3	

3	3	night came on, they laid themselves down near one another upon the moss,

3	

3	3	and slept until morning came, and their mother knew this and did not

3	

3	3	worry on their account.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Once when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused

3	

3	3	them, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near

3	

3	3	their bed. He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but said nothing

3	

3	3	and went into the forest. And when they looked round they found that

3	

3	3	they had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and would certainly

3	

3	3	have fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces

3	

3	3	further. And their mother told them that it must have been the angel who

3	

3	3	watches over good children.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Snow-white and Rose-red kept their mother’s little cottage so neat that

3	

3	3	it was a pleasure to look inside it. In the summer Rose-red took care

3	

3	3	of the house, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her mother’s

3	

3	3	bed before she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree. In the winter

3	

3	3	Snow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the hob. The kettle

3	

3	3	was of brass and shone like gold, so brightly was it polished. In the

3	

3	3	evening, when the snowflakes fell, the mother said: ‘Go, Snow-white, and

3	

3	3	bolt the door,’ and then they sat round the hearth, and the mother took

3	

3	3	her spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and the two girls

3	

3	3	listened as they sat and spun. And close by them lay a lamb upon the

3	

3	3	floor, and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its head

3	

3	3	hidden beneath its wings.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	One evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together, someone

3	

3	3	knocked at the door as if he wished to be let in. The mother said:

3	

3	3	‘Quick, Rose-red, open the door, it must be a traveller who is seeking

3	

3	3	shelter.’ Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was a

3	

3	3	poor man, but it was not; it was a bear that stretched his broad, black

3	

3	3	head within the door.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Rose-red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove fluttered,

3	

3	3	and Snow-white hid herself behind her mother’s bed. But the bear began

3	

3	3	to speak and said: ‘Do not be afraid, I will do you no harm! I am

3	

3	3	half-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside you.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	‘Poor bear,’ said the mother, ‘lie down by the fire, only take care that

3	

3	3	you do not burn your coat.’ Then she cried: ‘Snow-white, Rose-red, come

3	

3	3	out, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.’ So they both came

3	

3	3	out, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and were not afraid

3	

3	3	of him. The bear said: ‘Here, children, knock the snow out of my coat a

3	

3	3	little’; so they brought the broom and swept the bear’s hide clean;

3	

3	3	and he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and

3	

3	3	comfortably. It was not long before they grew quite at home, and played

3	

3	3	tricks with their clumsy guest. They tugged his hair with their hands,

3	

3	3	put their feet upon his back and rolled him about, or they took a

3	

3	3	hazel-switch and beat him, and when he growled they laughed. But the

3	

3	3	bear took it all in good part, only when they were too rough he called

3	

3	3	out: ‘Leave me alive, children,

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	  Snow-white, Rose-red,

3	

3	3	  Will you beat your wooer dead?’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When it was bed-time, and the others went to bed, the mother said to the

3	

3	3	bear: ‘You can lie there by the hearth, and then you will be safe from

3	

3	3	the cold and the bad weather.’ As soon as day dawned the two children

3	

3	3	let him out, and he trotted across the snow into the forest.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Henceforth the bear came every evening at the same time, laid himself

3	

3	3	down by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves with him as

3	

3	3	much as they liked; and they got so used to him that the doors were

3	

3	3	never fastened until their black friend had arrived.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	When spring had come and all outside was green, the bear said one

3	

3	3	morning to Snow-white: ‘Now I must go away, and cannot come back for the

3	

3	3	whole summer.’ ‘Where are you going, then, dear bear?’ asked Snow-white.

3	

3	3	‘I must go into the forest and guard my treasures from the wicked

3	

3	3	dwarfs. In the winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged

3	

3	3	to stay below and cannot work their way through; but now, when the sun

3	

3	3	has thawed and warmed the earth, they break through it, and come out to

3	

3	3	pry and steal; and what once gets into their hands, and in their caves,

3	

3	3	does not easily see daylight again.’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Snow-white was quite sorry at his departure, and as she unbolted the

3	

3	3	door for him, and the bear was hurrying out, he caught against the bolt

3	

3	3	and a piece of his hairy coat was torn off, and it seemed to Snow-white

3	

3	3	as if she had seen gold shining through it, but she was not sure about

3	

3	3	it. The bear ran away quickly, and was soon out of sight behind the

3	

3	3	trees.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	A short time afterwards the mother sent her children into the forest

3	

3	3	to get firewood. There they found a big tree which lay felled on the

3	

3	3	ground, and close by the trunk something was jumping backwards and

3	

3	3	forwards in the grass, but they could not make out what it was. When

3	

3	3	they came nearer they saw a dwarf with an old withered face and a

3	

3	3	snow-white beard a yard long. The end of the beard was caught in a

3	

3	3	crevice of the tree, and the little fellow was jumping about like a dog

3	

3	3	tied to a rope, and did not know what to do.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	He glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried: ‘Why do you

3	

3	3	stand there? Can you not come here and help me?’ ‘What are you up to,

3	

3	3	little man?’ asked Rose-red. ‘You stupid, prying goose!’ answered the

3	

3	3	dwarf: ‘I was going to split the tree to get a little wood for cooking.

3	

3	3	The little bit of food that we people get is immediately burnt up with

3	

3	3	heavy logs; we do not swallow so much as you coarse, greedy folk. I had

3	

3	3	just driven the wedge safely in, and everything was going as I wished;

3	

3	3	but the cursed wedge was too smooth and suddenly sprang out, and the

3	

3	3	tree closed so quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white

3	

3	3	beard; so now it is tight and I cannot get away, and the silly, sleek,

3	

3	3	milk-faced things laugh! Ugh! how odious you are!’

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The children tried very hard, but they could not pull the beard out, it

3	

3	3	was caught too fast. ‘I will run and fetch someone,’ said Rose-red. ‘You

3	

3	3	senseless goose!’ snarled the dwarf; ‘why should you fetch someone? You

3	

3	3	are already two too many for me; can you not think of something better?’

3	

3	3	‘Don’t be impatient,’ said Snow-white, ‘I will help you,’ and she pulled

3	

3	3	her scissors out of her pocket, and cut off the end of the beard.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	As soon as the dwarf felt himself free he laid hold of a bag which lay

3	

3	3	amongst the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold, and lifted it

3	

3	3	up, grumbling to himself: ‘Uncouth people, to cut off a piece of my fine

3	

3	3	beard. Bad luck to you!’ and then he swung the bag upon his back, and

3	

3	3	went off without even once looking at the children.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Some time afterwards Snow-white and Rose-red went to catch a dish

3	

3	3	of fish. As they came near the brook they saw something like a large

3	

3	3	grasshopper jumping towards the water, as if it were going to leap in.

3	

3	3	They ran to it and found it was the dwarf. ‘Where are you going?’ said

3	

3	3	Rose-red; ‘you surely don’t want to go into the water?’ ‘I am not such

3	

3	3	a fool!’ cried the dwarf; ‘don’t you see that the accursed fish wants

3	

3	3	to pull me in?’ The little man had been sitting there fishing, and

3	

3	3	unluckily the wind had tangled up his beard with the fishing-line; a

3	

3	3	moment later a big fish made a bite and the feeble creature had not

3	

3	3	strength to pull it out; the fish kept the upper hand and pulled the

3	

3	3	dwarf towards him. He held on to all the reeds and rushes, but it was of

3	

3	3	little good, for he was forced to follow the movements of the fish, and

3	

3	3	was in urgent danger of being dragged into the water.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The girls came just in time; they held him fast and tried to free his

3	

3	3	beard from the line, but all in vain, beard and line were entangled fast

3	

3	3	together. There was nothing to do but to bring out the scissors and cut

3	

3	3	the beard, whereby a small part of it was lost. When the dwarf saw that

3	

3	3	he screamed out: ‘Is that civil, you toadstool, to disfigure a man’s

3	

3	3	face? Was it not enough to clip off the end of my beard? Now you have

3	

3	3	cut off the best part of it. I cannot let myself be seen by my people.

3	

3	3	I wish you had been made to run the soles off your shoes!’ Then he took

3	

3	3	out a sack of pearls which lay in the rushes, and without another word

3	

3	3	he dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	It happened that soon afterwards the mother sent the two children to the

3	

3	3	town to buy needles and thread, and laces and ribbons. The road led them

3	

3	3	across a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn about. There

3	

3	3	they noticed a large bird hovering in the air, flying slowly round and

3	

3	3	round above them; it sank lower and lower, and at last settled near a

3	

3	3	rock not far away. Immediately they heard a loud, piteous cry. They ran

3	

3	3	up and saw with horror that the eagle had seized their old acquaintance

3	

3	3	the dwarf, and was going to carry him off.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The children, full of pity, at once took tight hold of the little man,

3	

3	3	and pulled against the eagle so long that at last he let his booty go.

3	

3	3	As soon as the dwarf had recovered from his first fright he cried

3	

3	3	with his shrill voice: ‘Could you not have done it more carefully! You

3	

3	3	dragged at my brown coat so that it is all torn and full of holes, you

3	

3	3	clumsy creatures!’ Then he took up a sack full of precious stones, and

3	

3	3	slipped away again under the rock into his hole. The girls, who by

3	

3	3	this time were used to his ingratitude, went on their way and did their

3	

3	3	business in town.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	As they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised the

3	

3	3	dwarf, who had emptied out his bag of precious stones in a clean spot,

3	

3	3	and had not thought that anyone would come there so late. The evening

3	

3	3	sun shone upon the brilliant stones; they glittered and sparkled with

3	

3	3	all colours so beautifully that the children stood still and stared

3	

3	3	at them. ‘Why do you stand gaping there?’ cried the dwarf, and his

3	

3	3	ashen-grey face became copper-red with rage. He was still cursing when a

3	

3	3	loud growling was heard, and a black bear came trotting towards them out

3	

3	3	of the forest. The dwarf sprang up in a fright, but he could not reach

3	

3	3	his cave, for the bear was already close. Then in the dread of his heart

3	

3	3	he cried: ‘Dear Mr Bear, spare me, I will give you all my treasures;

3	

3	3	look, the beautiful jewels lying there! Grant me my life; what do you

3	

3	3	want with such a slender little fellow as I? you would not feel me

3	

3	3	between your teeth. Come, take these two wicked girls, they are tender

3	

3	3	morsels for you, fat as young quails; for mercy’s sake eat them!’ The

3	

3	3	bear took no heed of his words, but gave the wicked creature a single

3	

3	3	blow with his paw, and he did not move again.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The girls had run away, but the bear called to them: ‘Snow-white and

3	

3	3	Rose-red, do not be afraid; wait, I will come with you.’ Then they

3	

3	3	recognized his voice and waited, and when he came up to them suddenly

3	

3	3	his bearskin fell off, and he stood there a handsome man, clothed all in

3	

3	3	gold. ‘I am a king’s son,’ he said, ‘and I was bewitched by that wicked

3	

3	3	dwarf, who had stolen my treasures; I have had to run about the forest

3	

3	3	as a savage bear until I was freed by his death. Now he has got his

3	

3	3	well-deserved punishment.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Snow-white was married to him, and Rose-red to his brother, and they

3	

3	3	divided between them the great treasure which the dwarf had gathered

3	

3	3	together in his cave. The old mother lived peacefully and happily with

3	

3	3	her children for many years. She took the two rose-trees with her, and

3	

3	3	they stood before her window, and every year bore the most beautiful

3	

3	3	roses, white and red.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859), were born

3	

3	3	in Hanau, near Frankfurt, in the German state of Hesse. Throughout

3	

3	3	their lives they remained close friends, and both studied law at Marburg

3	

3	3	University. Jacob was a pioneer in the study of German philology,

3	

3	3	and although Wilhelm’s work was hampered by poor health the brothers

3	

3	3	collaborated in the creation of a German dictionary, not completed until

3	

3	3	a century after their deaths. But they were best (and universally) known

3	

3	3	for the collection of over two hundred folk tales they made from oral

3	

3	3	sources and published in two volumes of ‘Nursery and Household Tales’ in

3	

3	3	1812 and 1814. Although their intention was to preserve such material as

3	

3	3	part of German cultural and literary history, and their collection was

3	

3	3	first published with scholarly notes and no illustration, the tales soon

3	

3	3	came into the possession of young readers. This was in part due to Edgar

3	

3	3	Taylor, who made the first English translation in 1823, selecting about

3	

3	3	fifty stories ‘with the amusement of some young friends principally in

3	

3	3	view.’ They have been an essential ingredient of children’s reading ever

3	

3	3	since.

3	3	Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of

3	

3	3	electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers

3	

3	3	including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists

3	

3	3	because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from

3	

3	3	people in all walks of life.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the

3	

3	3	assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm’s

3	

3	3	goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will

3	

3	3	remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project

3	

3	3	Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

3	

3	3	and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

3

3	

3	3	Literary Archive Foundation

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide

3	

3	3	spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of

3	

3	3	increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be

3	

3	3	freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest

3	

3	3	array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations

3	

3	3	($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt

3	

3	3	status with the IRS.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating

3	

3	3	charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

3	

3	3	States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a

3	

3	3	considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up

3	

3	3	with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations

3	

3	3	where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To

3	

3	3	SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any

3	

3	3	particular state visit http://pglaf.org

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we

3	

3	3	have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition

3	

3	3	against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who

3	

3	3	approach us with offers to donate.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make

3	

3	3	any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

3	

3	3	outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

3	

3	3	

3	

3	3	Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation

3	

3	3	methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
