time trust give deserve	
went master said worked hard long	
leaves silver glittered sparkled beautifully	
take bite laid bread near sewed joy made	
man head would go thus without pay longer	
three years without paid wages last came	
taste bitter said finish jacket	
farmer faithful diligent servant worked hard	
Till prisoner fast	
bottom found delightful grove trees	
piece right across loaf spread jam	
MISER BUSH	
strength brought bread cupboard cut	
nothing nail wall went	
shall blessed God cried little tailor give health	
seen since	
desired went away quite angry grumbling jam	
could get nowhere ran village one
